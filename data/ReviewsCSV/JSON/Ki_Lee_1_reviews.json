Exams are HEAVILY homework and definition based, although he leaves the difficult math out. Study the homework problems and memorize all definitions, including all equations he says are important.",

Although he uses the word &quot;physics&quot; alot, it seems he doesn't want you to think about the physics, just the equations.  There is no need to study the actual subject matter, just study the homeworks and equation sheet and you will do just fine.",
