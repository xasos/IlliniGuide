He is very clear on what he expects and explains the reading well, which helps greatly with Aristotle. I would reccomend him for any Philosophy class as he puts in jokes and will take questions throughout his lectures. Good guy",

He's a really bright and witty guy who makes Plato and Aristotle clear.
