The class was super easy though. With all of the extra credit (a ridiculous amount) I got 108% in the class. Try to get her for PSYC 201. Some of the other TAs aren't great, trust me.",

Also a great teacher, makes learning so simple and uses awesome examples to help you remember. easy easy class with ridiculous amounts of e.c. that boosted my grade by like 5%.",
