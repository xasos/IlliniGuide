I was extremely disappointed since I was very interested in Victorian literature prior to this class, now I hate it. Picked bad poems to read, and assignments were unnecessarily long. Paper prompts weren't clear. STAY AWAY!!!!!",

Reading is required for every class, attendance is mandatory, although you get a few excused absences. You have to work for your grade, but it is definitely worth it.",
