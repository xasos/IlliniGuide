I took a summer class with him, so a little different than usual, but overall I thought the class was challenging, yet very fair. Would really recommend taking a class with him, I learned a lot!",

One Criticism - depends a lot on student presentations but always gives a clear summary of the readings to indicate precisely what he's looking for.",
