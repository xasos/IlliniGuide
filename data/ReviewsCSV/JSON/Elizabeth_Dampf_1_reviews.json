This is not a class for you if you don't like to speak much, because she gives a lot of importance to class participation. To be honest this is a class for girls. Guy's stay away from this clas",

All her papers can be revised. So as long as you turn in your paper on time you get it back saying what you need to change, then just change it and get an A. Pretty easy overal",
