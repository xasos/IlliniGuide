He's a brilliant guy, but I think he expects his students to take responsibility for themselves much as he did when coaching sports.  If you want to be spoon-fed the answers, Dan's probably not the Prof for you.  The real world doesn't employ many people who need to be spoon-fed, though.",

Try to switch prof's if you get him!!",
