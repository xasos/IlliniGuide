The final is a little bit tougher than the exam but it is still easy to get a good grade on all the exams and homework assignments. He is a very good teacher and relates the material to everyday examples. He makes the class intresting even if you are not intrested in Economics",

Just go 2 discussions and look at old test and that is all you need to pass this class with an A or B.",
