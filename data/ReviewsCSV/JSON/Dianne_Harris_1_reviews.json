She expected a lot of her students, but if you attended lecture and put forth any effort, an A was absolutely possible. Great class and professor.",

Despite this fact, both the 314 (undergrad) and 514 (grad) sections were graded on the same high standards (graduate work standards), with even less tolerance and leeway for the undergrads. Interesting material, wait and take it as a graduate.",
