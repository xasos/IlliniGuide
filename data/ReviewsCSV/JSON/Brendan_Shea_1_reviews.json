The grading criteria, writing amount, and his expectations are easily obtainable if you attend class; not hard. Professor Shea cares about his students and is always open for office hours. Take him",

The writing amount is ridiculous for not being an advanced comp. Not interesting enough, i thought it would be more debating. Grading standard not clear and it seemed like complete opinion. Went in for help wasn't very helpful.Ridiculous",
