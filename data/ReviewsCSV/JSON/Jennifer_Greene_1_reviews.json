She encourages critical thinking. I loved it! A lot of reading, not so many assignments but a huge final project.",

We conducted a real evaluation, culminating in a presentation to the client. Invaluable experience for those interested in evaluation research. The theory class was also interesting although some of it went over my head :)",
