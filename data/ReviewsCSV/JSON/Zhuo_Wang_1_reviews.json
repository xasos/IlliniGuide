She gives learning objectives for every exam so basically a study guide. Study those and the exams are a piece of CAKE. I also learned a TON, she is so good at explaining things in terms we can understand. Great class, AWESOME professor!",

We had 5 homeworks and 5 exams (and 6 people in the class). The homework can be hard, but we always reviewed the day before exams, which really helps. She basically tells you exactly what will be on them.",
