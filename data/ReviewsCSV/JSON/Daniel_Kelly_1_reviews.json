Attend his office hours and ask him for critique on paper, he'll give great advice - follow them and you should get a good grade (I was able to get many As doing this). He has rewrite option for first couple papers. Quizzes in class - pretty easy and later on, open book. Not a blow off class, still need to put work into it",
