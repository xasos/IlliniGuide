However, professor Di Girolamo really is a good lecturer and helps you out.  He gives you all the lecture notes, so you don't really miss anything.  The only thing I wish this class had was an online component on Compass or a website.",

However, the class sessions themselves were wonderful - you get the sense that you might not find this same material explained this well anywhere else.",
