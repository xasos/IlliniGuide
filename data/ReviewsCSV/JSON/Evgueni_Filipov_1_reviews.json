The homework in his class is graded VERY harshly, so expect 4-6 hours of work per assignment and a low HW average. This class made me back out of a Structural Primary.",

I would highly recommend people wait until this guy has more teaching experience.  He is extremely disorganized and very difficult to follow.  He is very nice and I can tell he wants to help, so I think he'll improve over time.",
