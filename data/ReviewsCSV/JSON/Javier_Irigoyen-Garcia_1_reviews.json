His quizzes were easy and the homework assignments were graded for completion. I also thought he was funny, so i enjoyed going to class.",

He also won't keep the class in agony if everyone is bored or confused, he just lets you go till next time. Homework is easy and the papers aren't too bad if you've been paying attention and know your stuff.",
