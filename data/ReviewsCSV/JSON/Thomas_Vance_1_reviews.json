Very much so tries to involve the students in the conversation, so it is up to you to participate which will help you do better in the class. A lot of memo writing, and a huge final project but that is consistent for Accy304.",

If you feel cheated on grading talk to him because he is very willing to re-look over stuff and mostly gives you more points.  Midtermfinal blow.  It's part multiple choice from the book and a few mini cases.",
