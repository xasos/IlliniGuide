Readings are extremely interesting, class discussions helped, and for an advanced comp class there wasn't TOO much writing required. Highly recommended for anyone into studying media and actually learning things.",

The material is reasonably interesting and Tabe only makes you write two page response papers every week, two slightly longer papers and do a short video project. You must go to class, but all in all, I strongly recommend this class.",
