He is terrible at communicating what needs to be done, he's never around to help, and it didn't seem like he cared about the students at all. He knows his stuff so his lectures are in depth and interesting but if you are looking for a good grade in 301 in a summer section this isn't the guy",

But you always have to be on top of the readings and be prepared to be called upon to answer questions in class!!",
