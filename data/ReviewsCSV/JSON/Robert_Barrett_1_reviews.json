He's a total dork (I've taken Fantasy Lit and ComicsGraphic Narratives with him), but his enthusiasm is contagious, and it's really clear he loves what he's teaching about. He's a tough grader, so prepare to work hard and take his revisions to heart. Class is discussion based, so do the readings and participate. Recommended!!",
