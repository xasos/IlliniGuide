I tried very hard (had my speeches memorized), met with him outside of class and he would not give me better than an A- on a speech.  He ruins SPCM 101's reputation of an easy-A class.",

The only drawbrack is that the speeches are back to back, with little time in between, but i encourage people to take this class. even if you don't like public speaking, if you follow directions its an easy class to pass",
