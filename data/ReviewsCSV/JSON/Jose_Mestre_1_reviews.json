I.e. a few professors' research was based exclusively on how students learn best and making their class better (see smartphysics). I believe Jose himself didn't work on that, however his doctorate is in physics education. All in all he's no walter lewin, the man is simply your average very good physics professor. Can't really go wrong with him.",
