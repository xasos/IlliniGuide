I've even gone to him during non-office hours and he is willing to answer many questions. He is not that hard to understand, he just has a bit of an accent. Exams were very easy.  You can tell this guy loves sharing knowledge.  Would recommend for 400-level class.",

I'd definitely recommend him for anything above the 300 level or so.",
