He is very clear as to what is expected of you. He is very fair in how he grades. Projects are graded lightening fast. He was always available to help. He truly wanted us to learn the material. Great guy!",

His class also teaches you a lot of material, especially if you're new to finance.  Real-world examples also help you learn too.",
