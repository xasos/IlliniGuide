Lecture slides are a bit wordy but he covers everything in depth and clarifies any questions students have. Always patient and helpful. Tests are difficult but fairly scaled. If you pay attention and attend class regularly you will do fine on exams. Great professor!",

Tests are tough and tend to be set up a little strangely, but grading is extremely fair (80-100 is an A). Lab difficulty probably depends on TA, but if you get Jim you're good.
