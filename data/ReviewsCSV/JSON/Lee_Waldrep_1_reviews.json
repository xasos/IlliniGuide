He does keep somewhat of an attendance bc he uses iclickers during class. As long as you pay attention and get the study guides done, you will be fine. Good teacher overall",

Still helpful to take notes though. He uses an iclicker in class most of the time to get participation points. So while you don't NEED to go to class, you get points for going. A good teacher.",
