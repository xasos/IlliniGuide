Class consisted of artsy projects- making a graffiti, podcast, video, etc. You make a blog and write reflections, doesn't take too much time, in fact you will really enjoy the projects. Cory really cares about her students and goes out of her way to help them. Will not regret it, take this class with HER. Best adv. comp.",
