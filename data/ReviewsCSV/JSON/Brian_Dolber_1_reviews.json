He's open minded and I really loved his sort of Hipster style. He incorporated a lot of current events to the class which made it more intimate. Overall a great prof.",

H He gives very basic instructions for assignments, which he does not put in hard copy,so you always keep askng him to repeat himself. He didn't use a textbook,the readings he did post were online and were long (ie 70+ pgs)",
