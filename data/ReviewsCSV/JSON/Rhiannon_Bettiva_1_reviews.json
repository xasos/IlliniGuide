She says she does not read her course evaluations, which is a shame, because she really is quite knowledgeable and could be an awesome professor.  I just can't imagine subjecting myself to another one of her classes until her interpersonal skills improve.",

As this was a graduate level class, this tactic seemed very unnecessary as well as insulting.  Individually, though, she was understanding toward me.",
