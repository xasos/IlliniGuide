Not only are the class discussions interesting, but he always makes time during his office hours for students.  The workshop style format of the class works really well--it allowed me to get more comfortable in my own writing.",

Jon was very entertaining - he had great comments and great instruction - obviously knew what he was talking about. He maintained a professional, productive, and enjoyable atmosphere for the students. Easy class and you learn a lot!",
