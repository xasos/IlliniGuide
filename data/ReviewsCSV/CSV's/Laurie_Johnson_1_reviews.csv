N/A,good,average,good,0,21805231,0,,good,4,GER250,"One of the nicest, funniest professors out there. I thought the material sometimes dragged on throughout the semester, and that made me dread going to class at times. But she really is incredibly understanding and helpful. Take this Advanced Comp with her if you can! I think she is a fair grader too, as long as you know how to present an argument",05/21/2013,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

It's a delight to come to class and it's easy to see that she thinks so too. Students vie for spaces in her courses and it's certainly not just for the material.

All she does is talk about psychology in the tales, so you better have a really good understanding already going into the course if you want to succeed.
