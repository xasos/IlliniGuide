Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24549669,0,,good,5,ACE251,"Best nonwestern history class you could take, there is iclicker but its just for attendance. There is 3 midterms and a final, but he only takes your 3 highest grades on the 4 tests. There is no homework, and the discussions are mandatory but easy points. Interesting and funny in lectures too. The group project is the only downfall. don't buy txtbok",04/06/2015,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people

Winter-Nelson is also extremely likeable, fair, and understanding to students. Tons of extra credit opportunities. 3 term projects & 4 exams (including the final), one of which you drop.

His projects are so frustrating to do b/c there is a lack of direction and you have to spend so many hrs. looking up vague information.
