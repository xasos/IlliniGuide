I hated the course, but she actually made it not so bad. Get into her discussion classes!",03/18/2011,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She is fun, flexible, relatable and just all-around a nice person.  The class is about 2/3 based on the required textbook and novel, so definitely buy them.",12/04/2008,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
