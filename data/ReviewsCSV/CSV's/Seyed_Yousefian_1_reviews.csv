He reads examples and even confuses himself while completing them.  He gives out quizzes which you have under 2 minutes to complete and makes them a large part of your final grade.  Seriously avoid him, he is terrible.",03/08/2014,3,3.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people
Mandatory,poor,poor,average,0,22775726,0,,average,1,IE300,"A really easy class (on par with an AP Stats course you would take in High School), but Yousefian is one of the most frustrating lecturers. First, he makes you go to class with the threat of lecture quizzes, and then he just reads right off of his slides and messes up reading things repeatedly",01/21/2014,1,1.0,,4,Low,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A+,,people,people
Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,22348083,0,,poor,1,IE300,Terrible teacher. Puts up the slides you receive with the book and just reads through them in lecture. Also scrawls in Microsoft Paint. You need to go to lecture because he gives random lecture quizzes and they are PAINFUL. Avoid this guy at all costs - take STAT 400 if needed.,11/19/2013,4,4.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,C+,,people,people
