N/A,poor,good,poor,0,18505961,0,,poor,1,MUS133,Terrible narcissism professor. I should have taken another prof's class of MUS 133. Turino just keep talking about himself and both his class and exams have terrible writting sections. And it seemed that he don't want students have good grade since the Final study guide is a sh*t. He NEVER post things he should on compass. Write it by yourself!!!,05/02/2011,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,18445348,0,,good,5,MUS133,Turino is very passionate about music and really shows it in  lecture. I thought this class was pretty easy. He gives a study guide for the exams that makes the exams easy and the pop quizzes are manageable if you've been taking notes and run through them for 5 minutes. TAs are helpful as well. I only used the book for exam-studying and that was it,04/21/2011,2,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,good,good,0,18033368,0,,good,4,MUSIC133,Professor Turino is a wonderful professor who is extremely knowledgable about his area of study. He is extremely kind and helpful to all of his students. Politics always affect music - they're inseperable. His lectures are conversational (which is a GOOD thing - no one wants to be talked at)and also fascinating.
