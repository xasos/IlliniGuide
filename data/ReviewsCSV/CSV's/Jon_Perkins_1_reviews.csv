Must do the readings and understand them well for the exams. The grading for the exams were strange. You would get substantial points taken off for no reason. Argues about semantics.

The tests try to trick you, with most multiple choice having the options &quot;All of the above, None of the above, __ and __ above.&quot;  He tests every caveat of every reading.  He admits to having no experience in audit.  I can easily say I've never disliked a professor so much.",10/01/2008,4,4.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

However, the best part about his class is that his exams are all written!!! Also, his exams are based off the cases. One very good advice is to GO TO CLASS to find out solutions to the cases. Class is not that hard",12/26/2007,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
