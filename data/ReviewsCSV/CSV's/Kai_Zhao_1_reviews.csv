Not Mandatory,good,poor,good,1,22751065,1,,good,5,CS105,"Kai is the man. He gives a ton of extra credit. Go for him with help for the MP's and attending lectures is really helpful. A lot of the test questions are from the lecture, lab, MP's and weekly reviews. If you show up and do your work you'll get a good grade.",01/14/2014,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,person,person

He is a HORRIBLE public speaker which makes lecture almost unbearable to sit through, but if you don't go to lecture, you're even more lost.  Class was unorganized, inconsistent, and exams were difficult.  Definitely don't recommend it.  If you must take it, go to all of your discussions/labs!!",06/10/2013,4,4.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

He will explain stuff and help you a lot if you go to office hours, so I recommend that. TAs are okay; of course it depends on the TA.
