N/A,good,average,good,0,16586493,0,,good,5,MATH225,"I have taken a class much like this and thought this class would be a breeze. It was pretty easy, especially with Prof. Lee. He gives hand outs which summarize everything in the book in a comprehensible manner. His English is also very good and he does a good job at making sure the class can follow along. I wish he taught every math class here.",12/17/2009,2,2.0,,5,Low,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
