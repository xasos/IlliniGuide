Here's why: he's nice, funny, & a great speaker who gives amazing lectures. Best of all, you learn a lot & you're guaranteed an A. It's the perfect combination.",01/20/2015,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,23276257,0,,good,5,CLCV132,Awesome guy. Really has an interest in the class and the topics covered. Has a funny personality that he brings to lecture that made it easy to listen and pay attention in class. He posts all the lectures online. Not much work involved: a few worksheets and quizzes. There were 2 tests & the final which aren't bad at all if you do the study guides,05/19/2014,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

You have to do the readings because the quizes and tests will be kind difficult if you don't.  Also, class time goes a lot smoother if you did the reading.  He's very passionate, quirky/dorky, but so much fun. I'm taking the class again!",07/19/2013,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Quirky, laid-back guy and definitely passionate about classics which makes his classes really interesting. He can be a little unorganized though. But great lecturer and professor.",06/27/2013,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
