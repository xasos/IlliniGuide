Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25563273,0,,good,4,SHS170,Great professor. She gives really interesting lectures and is just a nice person. At the beginning of the year she even started lectures out talking slowly so we could understand her accent which was incredibly helpful. Great class but there is a lot of material to memorize and a few papers to do. ,12/06/2015,3,3.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,people,people
Mandatory,average,good,good,0,25488165,0,,good,3,SHS170,"Dr. Mudar has a lot of insight on her topics. She goes over a lot in class so don't try to take notes on every single slide because she does post them on Compass afterwards. Tests can be hard because you do go over so much in so little time, but I found all the topics extremely interesting (mainly because it's a huge part of my major).
