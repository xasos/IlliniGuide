N/A,good,good,good,0,17728578,0,,good,5,IB203,Very helpful and cares about students. Work very intense but if you do the work you can get an A. Hardest part is writing the scientific manuscripts.,11/04/2010,4,4.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

While the cowbell may feel demeaning, it's a reasonable way to regain the attention of the class.

N/A,good,good,good,0,15910808,0,,good,4,IB203,"She really cares about her students, and her teaching method is outstanding.  If you plan on a career in science, this class is probably the best undergrad prep you can get aside from independent study.  Those long assignments show you what the scientific method is in action.  Best prep course of my undergrad, helped me later on in so many classes.",05/29/2009,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,good,good,0,15663664,0,,good,4,IB203,Wow...carol is somebody else. She's extremely intense and makes you work constantly. This class is a TON of work. At some times it can be fun (catching fish in a river and working in forests/fields) but it's sooo much work. Probably the hardest class I've taken so far. Good luck with it...,04/16/2009,5,5.0,,5,Meh,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

With that said, the class is really rewarding and I felt I learned a lot.  You can't ask for a better professor who  cares more about her students (after all she is in charge of the IB Undergrad Curriculum).",04/05/2009,5,5.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,average,average,average,0,13791902,0,,good,3,IB203,The prof is really nice and she really does go out of her way to get to know your name. She teaches based on examples and her tests tend to revolve around interpreting graphs and &quot;applying&quot; what you &quot;learned&quot;. If you're in the lab be prepared to write alot and spend lots of time in the forest.,12/10/2007,2,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,12529986,0,,good,4,IB203,She was such a sweet lady and really cared about how her kids did in her class!  She can be a little intimidating calling on people randomly in class but the questions she asks aren't hard.  Her tests are all written so that was a little hard but she definitely knows what she's talking about and she seemed to to put a lot of effort into teaching.,12/06/2006,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
