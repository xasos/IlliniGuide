Not Mandatory,average,poor,average,0,26446714,0,,average,2,MATH285,"Easy A. Weekly quizzes are a breeze if you do the homework correctly. Exams are very easy. Boring lecturer and it's kind of tough to understand her sometimes, but she knows what she's talking about and she can explain things clearly if you ask. If you're smart, you can get by this class quite easily by reading the book instead of going to lecture.",05/03/2016,1,1.0,,3,N/A,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people
Not Mandatory,average,good,average,0,24431624,0,,average,3,446,"Have no idea what she is talking about in class some time. Her vocal delivery is terrible, she can't explain herself very well. Her grading was just not making any sense and she can't give a detailed explanation for any of her grading. She just simply say:""I don't understand what you are doing."" Anyway, never take her class!!",03/04/2015,4,4.0,,2,Low,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,WD,,people,people

N/A,poor,good,poor,0,21170970,0,,poor,1,MATH347,"Very unclear in her teaching. However, there were no tricks on any of her tests. Quizzes were unnecessarily hard. There was a clear gap between those who got it and those who didn't. She let those who didn't get it fall and she was very unsympathetic towards them. Office hours were hardly worth it.

N/A,good,good,good,2,18544635,2,,good,4,MATH446,Professor Wu is pretty clear when it comes to expectations and she's thorough with the material. I liked that.  I did not like quizzes every Thurday (which she gave you like 2 minutes to do) and tests where solutions end up being horrendous.  I thought I was going to do well...until I took the final.
