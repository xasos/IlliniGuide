In class, Prof. Schuler lectures to herself - no one can hear her - making attendance excruciatingly painful. Exams are very hard. 30+ hours studying per exam won't cut it. Got an A, but learned nothing - def. not worth the effort. This class should be abolished.",12/14/2012,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Her lecture style is horrible, and she makes everything unnecessarily difficult. The homework policy is totally bogus, and the exams are impossible.

Exams are EXTREMELY difficult and there aren't very many other points available to make up for it. The class was pretty easy if you can sit through the lecture, and there is a HUGE curve at the end!!",12/24/2010,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Third, she has a bogus homework policy. Last but not least, her exams are sooo hard! And you take more than the allotted time to finish the exams. Do Not take this class! Take Rivier's MCB 405 instead, way easier!",12/08/2010,5,5.0,,3,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Only 2/10 HW assignments are worth points, and they are randomly chosen.  Homework takes about 2 hours to complete each week, creating a huge waste of time.

You would think that would make it easy but it is god awful boring and the tests are ridiculously long and poorly worded/graded. Avoid this class if at all possible. Only redeeming quality is that it is curved since no one gets 100% on the tests",11/12/2009,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
