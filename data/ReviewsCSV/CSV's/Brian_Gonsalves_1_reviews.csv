Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24253665,0,,good,5,PSYC4320,"4 total exams, drops the lowest, so You can skip the final. Material is somewhat difficult, but Dr. Gonsalves is very good at explaining things. Lectures are long with no break and He reads off the slides, so You could skip class. Exam total is 75%, easy homework total is 25%. Curves at the end. Would definitely take again",01/08/2015,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Your grade is based on 3 midterms and easy homework assignments of recalling info from each week's lectures. If you do bad on a midterm, you can take a cumulative final in lieu of it.

Small fonton slides, test highly inconsistent with lecture materials.  Book readin is usless as well.

He gives numerous examples & answers any questions during class. I ended up with over 100 pages xtra. I started studying the night before-reread the slides and made a long SG.

The weekly homework assignments can be tedious but he grades them very easily. The midterm and final were a little challenging but as long as you study you'll be fine.

His class was fairly easy, but I learned almost nothing about psychology.  It's clear he doesn't care about his students and only teaches because he has to.
