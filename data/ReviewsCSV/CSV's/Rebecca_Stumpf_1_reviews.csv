N/A,good,average,good,0,23605332,0,,good,4,ANTH243,"Professor Stumpf was a fantastic professor. She is soft spoken and intelligent, and she loves what she does. She knows much about great apes, and has a lot of experience in studying African chimpanzees. I enjoyed the class very much, there was little work outside the classroom, and she provided ample information to pass the exams",09/21/2014,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,average,average,average,0,21013874,0,,average,3,ANTH343,Class was really disappointing. Prof is disorganized and not engaging. The subject matter could be really good but Stumpf makes it boring. Very few assignments and exams so all the points really matter.
