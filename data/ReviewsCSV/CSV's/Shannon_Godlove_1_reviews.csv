She also says &quot;Okay&quot; more times in 50 minutes than I do in a week.  Overall, a decent class.  But boring.",10/24/2008,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Talks down to students.  She is very awkward, always looking up at the ceiling when someone is talking to her.
