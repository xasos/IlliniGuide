He's open minded and I really loved his sort of Hipster style. He incorporated a lot of current events to the class which made it more intimate. Overall a great prof.",04/02/2012,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,average,poor,0,19625603,0,,poor,1,MCOM258,"Since starting to teach at SUNY Oneonta, he is very monotoned,& at times is very interesting to listen too. H He gives very basic instructions for assignments, which he does not put in hard copy,so you always keep askng him to repeat himself. He didn't use a textbook,the readings he did post were online and were long (ie 70+ pgs)",12/27/2011,2,2.0,,1,It's my life,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,19495640,0,,poor,2,MCOM258,I disliked him so much.  He seemed unsure about everything he said and his class lectures were so boring.  The tests werent bad if you did the 70 pages of reading a week which was a ridiculous amount for one class.  He seems educated in the subject but isn't clear on any of the material.,12/13/2011,5,5.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,average,average,average,0,13010831,0,,good,3,COMM264,He's a really nice guy and really interested in the material. Most of it is pretty interesting. TONS of reading...almost impossible to get it all done. The exam questions were kind of tricky. But he gives a lot of extra credit opportunities so an ok grade is possible.,04/14/2007,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
