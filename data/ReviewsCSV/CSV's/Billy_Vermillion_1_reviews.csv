His method of teaching is conducive to learning- watch a movie, discuss readings about the movie and other topics, watch clips that tie both readings and movie together. These clips provide inspiration for papers. I've said too much. Billy is awesome, if you have a chance, take his class.",09/04/2009,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Three 5-6 page papers and a midterm in class, no final (we had a final paper instead). Just come to class, do the papers, and enjoy. This guy is fun. I'd take him again.",05/20/2009,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
