N/A,good,average,good,0,18948440,0,,good,5,BADM300,Great professor. Really good explanations that make him really easy to understand. You MUST read though. If you don't read the book or at least take notes you will do bad. His tests are very unforgiving but he is a bit lenient when it comes to final grades.,08/24/2011,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

It's an interesting class because of his stories, but there's no way to get an A unless you read the text cover-to-cover and audiotape all classes... and then just maybe an A.

He couldn't care one bit about the grade you got, and was more interested in tells us about his many travels around the world and the work he did at his big law firm that let us in on a little secret we in the educational world like to call a grading scale.
