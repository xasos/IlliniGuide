I almost dropped it,but after talking to him he convinced me to stay in. He was very helpful and clear and I always enjoyed his lectures. He goes over sometimes, but he's an interesting person.

He lectures over the class time and slips his own personal views into his lectures. He seems to know a lot but teaches you NOTHING! Talks in monotone voice.
