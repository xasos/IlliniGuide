Lectures very informative, you can tell she's very knowledgeable about the subject and more than willing to help her students succeed. Looked forward to attending class.

I liked her as a professor and think with time she will improve",04/23/2013,3,3.0,,4,Low,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Lectures were boring-she read off the powerpoints,assigned readings had no relevance to assignments, if the topic you choose to write about isn't in her specialty you get downgraded. Awful professor.

N/A,average,good,poor,0,20750911,0,,poor,2,HIST200,"Emotions history. Completely awful professor. In class lectures have no relevance to assignments. A lot of reading used only for class discussions, doesn't transfer over to assignments. Hist 200 is req. for history majors and this section was available. Maybe she'll improve since this was her 1st year but I doubt it.",10/29/2012,4,4.0,,1,Low,1.5,1.5,3,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
