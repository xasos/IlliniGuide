N/A,poor,average,average,0,11695803,0,,poor,1,ECE411,His thick accent exacerbates his tendency to be unclear.    He spends more time on things that are obvious than on things that need more explanation.   The class lacks clear expectations of what students should be able to quantitatively do on tests.  The lecture was very boring even though I was interested in the subject. Nick Carter was better.,04/12/2006,3,3.0,,3,It's my life,2,2.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
