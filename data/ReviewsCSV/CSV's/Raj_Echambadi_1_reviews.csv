N/A,good,poor,good,0,21613076,0,,good,5,BADM590,"Raj is by far the best professor I have had during my time at UIUC. His class not only sticks with you once over, but does so with little effort. The man is a complete class act and really takes to heart the comments and work that students do. Finally he makes some of the greatest pop culture references ever!",04/26/2013,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
