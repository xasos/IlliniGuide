Mandatory,good,good,good,0,22678548,0,,good,4,ADV150,"Tale is the most down to earth professor that I've at at U of I. She was always helpful. Her quizzes were a little tough, but if you took good notes and skimmed the book, it shouldn't be hard to pass them considering that the quizzes were online and open note. She also offered so much extra credit to help out. Lectures okay, class overall easy.",12/31/2013,4,4.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A+,,people,people
Mandatory,average,good,poor,0,22561364,0,,poor,2,ADV150,"tale's class started off very simple, however her quizzes do not correspond to her lessons in the book or the quizzes. Her tests are confusing and badly written. I studied for hours and got a disappointing grade. She is extremely unhelpful and her lectures are dry, boring, and pointless. I recommend taking this class with a different professor.",12/15/2013,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,B,,people,people
