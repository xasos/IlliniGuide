Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,25576966,0,,poor,1,RST255,"Professor Hardin is the furthest from helpful or understanding. There are quizzes that you take during class and if you are not in class at the exact time they need to taken, you fail them. He is not at all understanding of conflict situations either. Do not take this class. ",12/07/2015,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Don was a decent professor but I didn't always enjoy how he handled things.  He called me out in front of the class multiple times to show what I did wrong. I know hearing criticism helps me but it really tore down my confidence. He never gives people JUST positive feedback.",05/23/2014,3,3.0,,3,Low,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,B+,,people,people

All of them were easy, because he sometime does an review of the material before each quiz, which makes it clear what you are expecting on the quiz. If you love talking about sports, you would fall in love with this class and the readings.",05/21/2013,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,20255425,0,,good,5,KIN239,I had Don for KIN 239 and he is one of the best professors I have ever had. He is a very personable mad and loves what he does. He does his best to make a boring class interesting by bringing in guest speakers/group presentations/giving breaks.  You need to purchase the book new because it comes with a code that you need for the final exam!,05/10/2012,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

For KIN 239, make sure to go to class though.  It may seem pointless at first, but he gives participation points at the end of class, so don't leave early!",12/15/2011,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
