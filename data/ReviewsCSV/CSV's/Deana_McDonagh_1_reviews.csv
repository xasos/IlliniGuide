N/A,poor,average,poor,0,21658533,0,,poor,1,TMGT366,Her communication skills are unprofessional and frustrating. She changed due dates multiple times with little notice. She frequently comes to class with either a very excited or very poor attitude and takes that out on the students. Her comments/feedback are rarely relevant and often misguided.,05/02/2013,3,3.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
