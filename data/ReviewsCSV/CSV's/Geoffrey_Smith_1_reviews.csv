N/A,good,poor,good,0,14437068,0,,good,5,FIN321,VERY helpful professor!  Puts great notes online and goes through them thoroughly in class! Attendance is optional but he explains the homework very well in class and its very helpful! Labs/cases can be tricky but go to class that day and he'll guide you through it no problem!  Exams are straightforward and easy for the most part!  Take his class!!,05/09/2008,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
