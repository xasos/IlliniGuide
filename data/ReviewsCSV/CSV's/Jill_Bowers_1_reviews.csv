Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24065504,0,,good,5,HDFS305,"Jill is AMAZING! This class is easy. You have to do a big research paper and she's really big on correctly citing with APA, but that's the one thing she will be strict with!!   She loves when you participate & gives extra credit to overachievers or just randomly in class. She's also a great resource and mentor or just someone to ask for advice!",12/13/2014,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people
