N/A,average,good,average,0,23219871,0,,poor,2,MATH415,"This professor seems very unprepared at times. In more than one lecture, he could not figure out how to derive certain theorems, and left the class very confused. He posted a ""mock"" final but failed to provide the class with the solution; basically it doesn't seem like he cares about his students at all. He acts like teaching is a chore to him.",05/11/2014,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,1,23208047,0,,poor,1,MATH415,He is undoubtedly the worst professor I have ever had.  He is very unclear during lectures he speaks at the board and has terrible handwriting.  The exams seem fair until you receive them back and he took off more than half of the points for one computation error.

Not Mandatory,poor,poor,poor,6,23170258,0,,poor,1,MATH415,He literally has no accent and doesn't speak into the board at all. He always articulates every word super clearly and everything he says is totally relevant to the current topic. His handwriting is also like high-definition clear. I never have any trouble reading what he writes. He's so good that nobody ever misses class. Basically this guy sucks.,05/05/2014,1,1.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Exam questions usually have a proof or two, which is unfair considering proofs take a while to think about. This leads to an unfair score overall on the exam.

Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,23013820,1,,poor,1,MATH415,Pretty much the most useless professor out there.  He rambles on in his lectures which is very hard to follow.  Homework is pretty much all theoretical.  Exams are hard and graded absurdly.  Two arithmatic mistakes result in half credit for each exam problem.  There are 5 questions on his exams and 2/5 of them are long and hard proofs.,04/09/2014,4,4.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
