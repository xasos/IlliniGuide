N/A,good,average,good,0,23020469,0,,good,5,ARCH101,"Good professor. He uses guest lecturers most of the time so it keeps class interesting. Fair with his grading. Make sure you do the sketching and journal assignments. He does keep somewhat of an attendance bc he uses iclickers during class. As long as you pay attention and get the study guides done, you will be fine. Good teacher overall",04/10/2014,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,23020451,0,,good,4,ARCH101,"He is a good teacher. He makes use of other guest lecturers to do most of his class. Class is quite easy because he gives a study guide before the exams. Still helpful to take notes though. He uses an iclicker in class most of the time to get participation points. So while you don't NEED to go to class, you get points for going. A good teacher.",04/10/2014,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,poor,good,0,20814095,0,,good,5,ARCH101,"He is very fair. If you show up, pay attention, and do the work, it's an easy A. The tests are almost 100% information from class plus a little common sense. He can be harsh if you don't do these things though.
