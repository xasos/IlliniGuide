Not Mandatory,average,good,poor,0,22229907,0,,poor,2,BIOC440,"It's very hard to follow cause he doesnt go by chapters. My test 2 covers chap 2,3,4,16,17,21,23. He also gives pop quiz which covers only 10% of what he taught in class. If yo have good luck and focussed on the 10% topic u can get full marks.
