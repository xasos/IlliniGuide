You have 1-2 long scholarly articles to read each class which are like 25 pages long. Luckily, she gives you questions to guide you through. Material was very interesting though and you can easily relate to everyday life. She is a very nice lady too!",11/02/2015,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
