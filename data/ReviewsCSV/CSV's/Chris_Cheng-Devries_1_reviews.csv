Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25985269,0,,good,4,IB426,"Chris is clear with her stuffs and she is trying to balance the grade and give extra credits/homework to help students get good grades. Lectures are interesting but you need to memorize a lot of things, so be prepared to take notes well and DO NOT skip classes (you do not want to, why? it is interesting and she is an interesting person).

The exams are extremely difficult and require you to know more than what is presented in lecture.She is very nice and helpful when you go to office hours, it's just too bad her class doesn't reflect that",01/11/2011,5,5.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

But she offers extensive study guides for each exam, which are WAY helpful. Exams are hard, but curved appropriately.

Don't be intimidated by the first exam, I think it's intended to weed out lazy people who aren't really interested in the material.  Just do the reading, it'll help and memorize constants!

Somewhat recommended. Specific to this class: EXTREMELY high emphasis on org. chem (more chem than bio). Difficult (but fairly curved) tests w/lots of emphasis on minutiae.
