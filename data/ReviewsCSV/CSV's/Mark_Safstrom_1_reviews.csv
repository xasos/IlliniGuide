N/A,average,good,average,0,24309091,0,,poor,2,SCAN240,This class is definitely too much work for a gen ed. It was way more work than my other gen ed's combined. He also has a very confusing grading system where he grades papers out of 3 points. I think this class would be ideal if you are a scan major as you learn a lot and he knows his stuff but don't take if you're just looking to fulfill a gen ed. ,01/20/2015,4,4.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
