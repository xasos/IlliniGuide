N/A,poor,good,poor,0,22337581,2,,poor,1,GEOG104,"Wilson rambles on about the topic in broad terms that makes it very difficult to understand. His power points are typed in ALL CAPS WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO COPY WHILE HE IS RAMBLING ON ABOUT GIVING YOU ""TIME TO COPY THE NOTES"" Also, the discussion section content does not correlate back to lecture.

The class itself is not difficult, but you MUST attend to see the slides. He doesn't post them online. He grades a little hard, and getting an A is hard, but getting a B+ is easy. DO NOT buy the note packet from Notes 'n' Quotes because you won't use it.",11/02/2012,2,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

The only complaint is I wish he would post his slides for us to study from.
