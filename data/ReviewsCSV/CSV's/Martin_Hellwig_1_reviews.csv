N/A,poor,good,poor,1,26556832,0,,poor,1,CS105,"An intro class at the 100 level should not be this hard, but somehow this professor makes it so. The class is disorganized, with MPs released a week after they are assigned and various class slides not being released at all. I'm pretty disappointed in how the class went this semester, as I was really looking forward to the subject material.",05/12/2016,4,4.0,,1,N/A,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person

CS 105 is the most overwhelming class I've taken in college. I feel like I learned nothing. And I will never take this class again.",04/26/2016,4,4.0,,1,N/A,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
