He is pretty boring and has no problem asking a question, then leaving the class in an awkward silence for a while. He's really smart, really willing to help and work with you, but he's Ferris Beuhler-esk.",05/05/2010,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Which is a total shame, because I love history.

He gives random quizzes for attendance to lectures and there's a lot of reading. But it's not a very difficult class.
