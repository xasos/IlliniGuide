He got sick late into the semester so got absolutely NO feedback on any of our projects so we still didn't know if we were doing the project according to the way he liked it. Believe me, its either his way or the highway. Also literally spent an entire class talking about shoes.",08/26/2008,3,3.0,,3,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
