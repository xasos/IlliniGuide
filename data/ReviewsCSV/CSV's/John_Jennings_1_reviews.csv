A typical critique comment would be &quot;that just, doesn't flow, you know what I mean&#63;&quot; He is not very precise or anal about design--he just wants it to look good. If you're searching for hard criticism, he is not for you! Try Daniel Goscha or Jennifer Gunji.",11/14/2006,1,1.0,,3,It's my life,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,11384978,0,,good,5,IMAGEMAKING1,John is a great guy.  He helps improve you in any way possible.  He is the kind of person who would give their shirt off their back for you.  His insight into Hip Hop is useful with Graphic Deisgn Skills.  Not an easy grade but A-B range if you put effort into the class.  I HIGHLY recommend taking ANY of his classes just to experience his style.,01/18/2006,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
