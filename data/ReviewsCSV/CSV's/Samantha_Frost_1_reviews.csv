Go to lecture, take notes, pay attention, keep up with the reading, and make sure to go see her during office hours. Don't expect to glide by, and you'll definitely enjoy this class!",05/11/2012,5,5.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Keep up with the reading, attend lecture, and you will get a good grade if you put in effort. I'm so glad I took this class- the political context was so good for the feminist ideas. Frost's a good lecturer and interested in us. Expects a lot",12/19/2008,4,4.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

If you are accustomed to just gliding through remedial classes without putting forth much effort, then yes, she will seem &quot;ridiculously demanding&quot;. If you're looking to LEARN, try one of Frost's classes!",10/09/2008,5,5.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She's genuinely excited about what she teaches and is very enthusiastic. She wants students to learn and become critical thinkers. Intimidating at first (to weed out ppl) but friendly, fun, & helpful during one on ones and later on.",12/04/2007,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

You'll probably also have to write papers on what you've read and you'll have to compare and contrast things. The good thing is that you will actually learn something unique and fascinating.,08/18/2007,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
