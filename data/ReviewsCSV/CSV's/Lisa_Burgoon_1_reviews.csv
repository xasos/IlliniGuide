N/A,good,average,good,0,26449735,0,,good,4,AGED260,"Lisa was great. Lectures were pretty boring because she read off of powerpoints, but she was enthusiastic to teach. Group projects and papers were worth the most points and the class isn't hard as long as you do the work. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in leadership! Lisa is a very reasonable and helpful person.",05/03/2016,2,2.0,,4,N/A,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people

She is fun and active; considering she has taught this course since the beginning of the minor, she knows what she is talking about. Discussions are pointless but fun.
