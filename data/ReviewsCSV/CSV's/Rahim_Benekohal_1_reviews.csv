N/A,good,average,good,0,25842752,0,,good,4,CEE416,"The class is slightly disorganized and he makes it more confusing than necessary. Test questions are often NO partial credit. The project is not too bad if you split up the work. Honestly the TA was the downfall; she hardly graded anything in less than a month. Study extremely hard for the tests, go to office hours for help on HWs, and you'll pass.",12/29/2015,3,3.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,B+,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,24167225,0,,poor,1,416,"This class sucked.  The professor might as well have been your condescending old grandmother.  Was no help at all in any stage of the class.  Almost all the learning has to be done on your own.  The grading procedure was horrendous,  points were taken away just to take away points.  DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.

Not Mandatory,poor,average,average,0,23871334,0,,average,1,CEE416,"Really helpful. The reason is you can learn nothing from the professor. To pass the exams, you have to learn all the knowledge by google or textbook or wikipedia. This course pushes me really hard and train my self-study ability. What's more helpful is the project actually, since no instruction will be provided in class no matter what you ask.",11/21/2014,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
