The class does more actual analysis of texts than he does.  He makes a blanket statement, which he retracts ten seconds later.  He doesn't remember characters and important details from the novels.  He should still be in school.",12/17/2009,4,4.0,,1,It's my life,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
