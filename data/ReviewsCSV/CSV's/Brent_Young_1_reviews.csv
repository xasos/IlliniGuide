Mandatory,good,average,good,0,26134888,0,,good,5,CEE320,"Very good lecturer! It was the only class I enjoyed going to. The SP is long,  but they are very lenient on grading. The final was actually kinda hard and dropped me to an A- so watch out for that. Overall, he curves the class around an A-/B+, so you're good there, but really take this class because you learn things you actually want to learn.",03/11/2016,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people

Group project is graded generously. Material is presented in a very pleasant way. Ask questions! Overall I liked the class, but the tests demanded insanely specific info that he only mentioned once in class.",05/28/2015,4,4.0,,4,Meh,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B+,,people,person

His lectures are very engaging, and interesting. And he makes it very easy for students to succeed.",05/25/2014,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A-,,people,people
