Mandatory,poor,average,poor,0,26660373,0,,poor,1,PSY361,"Professor Salusky, discourages questions. When a student asks a question, she makes you feel very dumb for asking a certain question. She doesn't know her own material as she reads off a piece of paper and it is exactly out of the textbook. She encourages her students to memorize everything, when she can't memorize her own material.",05/27/2016,3,3.0,,1,N/A,1,1.0,1,Yes,No,1112,Yes,,B+,,people,people

Has a very confusing way of explaining things. Sometimes has random attendance checks for points.  Semester long project taught everyone very little...more like busy work.

It's so hard to pay attention to her and she doesn't know what she is talking about. she had to look up the answer to someone's question on google during lecture. i asked her if something specific would be on the exam and she said no and then there were 2 questions on it. avoid her.,12/15/2010,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The writing prompts and research are super easy though. She seems too busy with other projects to handle teaching well.
