Group project is ok, final paper is 10 pages, which is pointless. Paper was the only thing I did not like.

Final project consisted of 14 pg group paper, 10 pg individual paper, a class presentation, all on top of a CUMULATIVE FINAL. Worked harder for this 3 hour class than the 7 hours of 300/400 classes I was taking. Just awful. Avoid.",12/15/2008,4,4.0,,2,Meh,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
