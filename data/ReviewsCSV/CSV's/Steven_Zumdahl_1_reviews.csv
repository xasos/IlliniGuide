I never took a class with you but we are using your AP chem book(9th ed) & I have a few constructive criticisms. 1st I don't understand how octahedrals contain 6 bonds, doesn't octa mean 8? And 2nd on p. 481, Figure 10.34 says there are red Zn ions, but they're actually purple. But overall the book is  helpful.
