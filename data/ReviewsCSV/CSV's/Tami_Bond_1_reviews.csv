Nice professor who can answer questions to the fullest. Someone else said, she invented this class, but it was a little to vague for my tastes. Much different than the other 300's.

Overall the course is not hard if you pay attention and be involved in the homeworks. A small part of your grade is 1-min speeches and presentations.

She basically constructed the EGE course by herself and made it interesting! She's very helpful and great to talk to!
