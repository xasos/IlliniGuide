Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24165398,0,,good,4,ENG175,"I definitely feel like I learned a lot in her class, and the discussions were always engaging and well-structured. A nice variety of projects--though she did have some weird quirks about how you should write your papers. But overall an engaging class that you can easily pass with a little time and effort, and you'll probably look forward to going!",12/22/2014,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

The work load is fairly high (20 pgs reading per class, weekly blog entries, three papers), but Mary knows her stuff and makes it interesting.
