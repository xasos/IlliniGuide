Mandatory,average,good,average,1,25775933,0,,average,2,BCH369,"Grabner does care about her students. However, the flipped model for biochem was horrible. This was an agonizing class. Lectures are mandatory and pointless. Tests were all multiple choice consisting of nothing but facts from her posted lecture slides. Tests usually averaged around a 65 for 250 students. I strongly advise against taking this class.",12/19/2015,4,4.0,,3,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,people,person

Lecture is almost pointless as you spend the whole time answering ten simple clicker questions. Exams are pretty tough but doing the LO do really help.

Flipped model components include learning modules, learning module surveys, sapling hwks, iclicker questions - all in addition to lecture slides, lecture videos, exams, PLUS sessions and PLUS quizzes (extra credit).
