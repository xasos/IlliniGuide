She is actually really nice if you dont assume everything she says is wrong and point it out to her. She does go thru the material quickly, but thats b/c there is so much to cover in the course.

When Dantzig came back, he completely contradicted her answer.  Goes through lecture notes too quickly, and gets angry for a student not understanding a complex subject that she doesn?t even explain correctly.

She gets confused a lot and sometimes teaches false info, only to be caught by students, so you're probably better off not going.
