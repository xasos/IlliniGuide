It's accounting, so the material isn't the greatest, but she makes the course bearable.  Tests were tough, but fair.  The cases take a decent amount of time, so hope for a good group.  There might be a slightly better option for 302 (Sandretto), but she was pretty good.",07/24/2011,4,4.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
