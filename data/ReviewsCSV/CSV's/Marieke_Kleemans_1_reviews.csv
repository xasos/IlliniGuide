Mandatory,poor,average,poor,0,26060886,0,,poor,1,ECON490,"This is the most time wasting professor I have ever seen. She spends at least 30 minutes of each of her lessons on explaining poorly written homework guidelines or slides. The rest of the time she spends explaining descriptive statistics graphs.  Grading emphasizes  form over substance. If you want to learn Economics, do not take her class.",02/16/2016,2,2.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,people,people
