N/A,good,average,good,0,14839197,0,,good,5,RHET243,Harmony Neal was one of the best teacher's I've ever had. I had her while she was cramming to finish her thesis and despite that she was still one of the only teacher's to seamlessly combine invaluable writing advice with a casual atmosphere that encouraged questions and opinions of any and every ilk. Take her class.,09/28/2008,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She's super helpful im her comments on papers, and goes out of her way to help if you need it. She's got a fun laid back attitude in class that I really loved. I'd recommend anyone to take her class.",05/25/2007,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,12032776,0,,good,4,RHET105,Harmony is amazing! She is extremely laid back and is hysterical. She talks like a teenager and makes you feel like her equal. Only in this class will you randomly have days where you watch Wonder Showzen in class HA,06/25/2006,2,2.0,,5,Low,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
