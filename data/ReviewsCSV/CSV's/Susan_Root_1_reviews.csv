N/A,good,average,good,0,12652089,0,,good,5,SHS120,This class was interesting and the instructor is good. Her lectures were clear. There were quizzes and a few assignments. The exams were not difficult. She & the TAs always returned the assignments as soon as they were graded and grades were posted on Compass. I would recommend this class. The only problem was that it was 2hrs and 50 min.,12/20/2006,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I got a B and never went, so it's not too bad. What sucked the most was that you had no clue how you were doing in the class until grades came out.",06/23/2005,2,2.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She has seniors in SHS grading the papers and daily quizzes (ugh), and half of the class leaves after the quizzes. She does NOT post grades online and her grading is quite a bit off. She's a nice enough lady but not a good prof.",12/18/2004,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
