N/A,average,average,average,0,24383581,0,online,poor,3,ATMS322,Worst online professor I've ever had. She hardly ever answered emails or questions in the Q&A forum. She wouldn't grade assignments until you emailed her multiple times asking about it. She changed deadlines for quizzes sometimes without telling the class that the deadline had been changed.
