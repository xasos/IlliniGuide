N/A,good,average,good,1,19708907,0,,good,4,MACS101,"Tabe was an overall awesome teacher; he's real with the content he teaches as well as his grading. Readings are extremely interesting, class discussions helped, and for an advanced comp class there wasn't TOO much writing required. Highly recommended for anyone into studying media and actually learning things.",01/11/2012,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
N/A,good,average,good,0,19295954,0,,good,4,MACS101,"This is actually a pretty easy class and for all those business majors it fulfills your advanced comp. The material is reasonably interesting and Tabe only makes you write two page response papers every week, two slightly longer papers and do a short video project. You must go to class, but all in all, I strongly recommend this class.",11/22/2011,2,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
