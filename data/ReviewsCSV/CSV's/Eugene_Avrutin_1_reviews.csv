N/A,good,average,good,0,22565413,0,,good,4,HIST355,Prof. Avrutin is a super cool guy who makes the material interesting. Even if you don't read any assigned books you can still get a lot out of his lectures and discussions. Exams are relatively easy and there's no papers which is rare for a history class.
