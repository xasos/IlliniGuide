N/A,good,average,good,0,25896552,0,,good,5,ECON414,"One of my favorite econ classes I've taken, and fave professor too!  He actually makes the material interesting and doesn't over complicate it. No math is required and explains graphs really really well. A little unclear though on what he was expecting on exams, almost never got full points on an answer. But can def get at least a B in the class.",01/07/2016,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

He'll usually talk about public policy in one city and then say why it worked or didn't work or talk about rent, transportation, housing, etc. It was my favorite Econ course at U of I. The averages are low but there is a very generous curve at the end.",05/07/2010,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I would not missing ANY classes as there is at least one problem from each lecture on each exam. Exams are hard, and to do well you really need to know the material. Put in some work and you'll get at least a B with the curve.",12/28/2009,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
