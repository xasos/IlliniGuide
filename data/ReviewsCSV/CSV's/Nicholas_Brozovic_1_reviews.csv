N/A,good,poor,good,0,16319117,0,,good,5,ACE100,This class was very easy. Test are similar to past exams. The final is a little bit tougher than the exam but it is still easy to get a good grade on all the exams and homework assignments.

He makes the class intresting even if you are not intrested in Economics,11/05/2009,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,average,average,0,15659141,0,,average,3,ACE100,"The material is extremely vague.  No curve.  Tests are a lot like the past exams he gives out, go to discussion it helps.  Lecture notes is all the additional material given, if there was an actual book this class might be better.  I recommend going to Parkland/local community college to take any 100 level Econ course.",04/16/2009,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,14230805,0,,average,3,ACE100,Brozovic comes off as a nice guy but this class is a joke.  The class notes are so vague that you dont learn anything w/ them.  I suggest skipping all of Brozovic's lectures because they are boring and a waste of time w/ no educational value. Just go 2 discussions and look at old test and that is all you need to pass this class with an A or B.,04/02/2008,4,4.0,,2,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He explains material thoroughly and makes ag econ a lot of fun. Every once in a while he will bring food in for you to eat. The TAs are also good for this class. If you need an econ credit go with ACE 100, but only in the spring when Brozovic teaches it.",02/26/2008,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,poor,average,0,14051670,0,,good,2,ACE100,One word to describe him: Phenomenal. He is so good at what he does and easy too. He know how to explain difficult concepts. The class isn't too bad and it counts as ECON 102. The college of ACES makes you feel cared for and important.
