Not Mandatory,average,good,average,0,24580510,0,,average,2,GEOG401,"He seems extremely smart but sometimes forgets he is teaching undergrads. Hard class! It was heavy on mathnumber crunching. He is helpful if you ask questions, but it is easy to get lost. Slight accent, talks fast, does not post grades online, no class schedule posted, limited notes posted. Uses chalkboard. Nice guy and considerate though. ",04/12/2015,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B-,,people,people

He said once in class (and yes, this is an engineering class) that &quot;practical equals boring, to me.&quot; The final exam was worth 75% of our grade, was a hella-hard take-home final, and covered a bunch of stuff that we never went over in class.",05/12/2010,4,4.0,,2,It's my life,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Siva made it pretty interesting, but was often hard to follow due to speaking very fast and assuming people knew things they didn't.  Was very helpful outside of class, though, and coursework was minimal.
