Lecture was interesting and entertaining, but the lab for this course is ridiculously difficult for no reason. You have to remember so much about the animals that it was very impossible for me to. I also did not enjoy the lab homework. Do NOT take this course.",12/30/2013,5,5.0,,3,Meh,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

You can skip every single lecture and just print the notes off the website and review in your own time for the tests and squeak by with a C. Don't bother with the book.
