You don't book a single journal entry, but you do have to apply concepts of internal control systems. This involves thinking of the bigger picture which is probably why accounting majors struggle.

He is knowledgable and experienced. The class was hard b/c content is so tangible but Martin teaches you to think rather just to study like a monkey. Although I got B, which is disappointed, I would recommend him!!",04/26/2013,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

The class lasts nearly 2 hours but, could easily be 1.  He is not willing to help students and is more involved in his research.  The TA slept every class period or texted.

It's annoying how little structure there is to the class and how smart he thinks he is. The class was interesting at first, until I realized the professor and material was all smoke and mirrors.

It is a total waste of time and is pure busy work.  The previous poster that said dumb kids feel smart is completely correct.
