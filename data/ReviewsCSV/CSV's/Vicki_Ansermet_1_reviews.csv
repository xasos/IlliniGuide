N/A,good,poor,good,0,15359777,0,,good,5,EPS202,She is the best EPS 202 TA. So easy.. like ridiculously easy.. Don't have to do anything besides the papers. Other TA's gave so many other assignments and we didn't have to do anything. She really cares about our schedules and was sympathetic with the amount of work she gave.
