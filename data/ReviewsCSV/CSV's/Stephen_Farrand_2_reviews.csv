N/A,average,good,average,0,17510788,0,,good,3,MCB250,Farrand wants you to think practical and apply what he teaches to ideal experiments. In order to succeed in his class you must understand simple concepts and how everything is related. It helps to ask questions during the lecture or attend office hours because the quizzes are graded strictly. The exams are difficult and should not be taken lightly.,08/13/2010,4,4.0,,4,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I went to see him in office hours and he was very helpful and liked to anwser my questions. I liked him more after office hours. I wish I had done it earlier in the semester because I did alot better on the test when I went to his review sess",07/14/2009,5,5.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
