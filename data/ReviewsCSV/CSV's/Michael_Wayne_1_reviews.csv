N/A,good,poor,good,0,13878671,0,,good,5,ENG104,"A lot of people thought he was a joke, but I was quite the opposite. I thought he was always very well prepared for class and had a very knowledgable background in the subject. The class was easy if you went to the movies and class. 3 short, 3-4 page papers on easy stuff to write about- more opinion than research. I'd definitely reccommend it.",12/19/2007,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I missed one of my 'big' assignments but i think he thought he lost it, i still got an A. I literally only went to class whenever i felt like getting up. A lot of times I'd sleep in to find out he canceled class anyways. Take his class.",10/08/2007,1,1.0,,3,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Only bad thing is that he often didn't show up to class since he would miss his bus. Therefore, we would waste our time by showing up. We wrote about movies, not books, which rocked. Don't worrt if you miss a movie/don't read an article, it won't matter. We only had 3 papers.",11/04/2006,1,1.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
