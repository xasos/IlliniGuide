N/A,average,good,good,0,24913795,0,,good,3,PSYC357,"Professor Hummel MADE my college experience.  His class material is interesting - he presented it in a way that expanded my curiosity.  He challenged me and fostered the growth of my analytically thinking abilities.  After receiving a 340 on my first exam with him, he taught me study methods that lead to me getting an A- in his class.

Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,22555552,0,,good,4,PSYC357,"As a computer science major taking this class, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of CS-related topics in the second half of the semester. Some bits on AI, machine learning, neural networks, computability, and information, number, and probability theory. 3 tests, 3 quizzes, one of each is dropped. No homework. Go to lecture or you'll fail.",12/14/2013,3,3.0,,5,Low,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

It's crosslisted and should NOT be because it's really out of reach for most regular PHIL students. He is into the topic but he doesn't help much to make it easy.",12/05/2013,5,5.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Hummel is an amazing lecturer - though be prepared for a lot of cursing if you're easily offended. He's so excited about the topic that it's infectious. There is no textbook, but there are very lengthy readings.",04/02/2013,5,5.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
