The homework is long (get comfy with 2 am SunR nights), and oddly worded. The office hours (for both prof and TA) are must haves for truly understanding the material. This course is static deformable bodies,  you need it for the fun stuff. Exams are slightly above HW.",12/16/2014,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,person,people

The grader we had was also really tough. He was very helpful in office hours. Exams had problems that weren't clear on how much you needed to solved to get credit.",05/29/2011,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
