Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,26587969,0,,good,5,ACE345,Paulson is a pretty cool and laid back guy.  Only have to go to 50% of classes and he posts the lectures on compass. He gives you the past exams to study and they are pretty much just like the exams he gives.  The 8 homework assignments kind of suck but I found past answers online.,05/16/2016,2,2.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Do the practice tests, they are exactly like the tests.  Paulson is a cool guy, but a bit of an overgrown frat star.  He also doesn't like to answer in class questions.",12/18/2013,1,1.0,,3,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Also, I was someone coming in with absolutely no accounting background and with the way he taught it was easy to pick up. Exams are a bit difficult but he tells you exactly what you'll need for it.",12/18/2013,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
