The only time I ever learned anything in this class was in the discussion groups with our TA. Don't take this class if you have the option of choosing something else!!!",06/16/2011,3,3.0,,1,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,poor,average,0,17488153,0,,poor,3,AFRO100,"The single worst teacher at the University of Illinois. Disorganized. Rude. Took pride in embarrassing students, and he did that frequently. Lectures have nothing to do with material in the book. Exams, while online, still reflected nothing in the lectures. NEVER take a class with Lou Turner, and I'm shocked such a prestigious school hired him.",08/06/2010,1,1.0,,1,Really into it,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
