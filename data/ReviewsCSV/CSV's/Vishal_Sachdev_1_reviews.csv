I didn't like the way the class was structured (lots of discussion posts and then critiques of others' posts) and the final project required more skills than the average person without much of a tech background had.  The material was interesting though, so this class would be great with a better professor",01/09/2014,2,2.0,,2,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

He is very knowledgable and funny and is very willing to offer help, as long as you ask for it! His tests do include a lot of memorization, but luckily they aren't worth too much of your grade. I also felt that he always graded homework fairly.",11/29/2011,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

This is the first time I have ever left negative feedback on any professor. THE WORST ever in all aspects including structure of course, grading, and teaching skills. Very narrow minded as well.

He doesn't announce the assignments, compass HW is posted 12 hours before it's due, and you don't know what to expect on tests. The tests are memorizing the hundreds of IT words you read - nothing more. I expected more from a 300-level class.
