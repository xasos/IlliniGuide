The class is easy, but somehow Nick manages to make things 10x harder than what they really are.  He's always jumping from idea to idea, and goes ""EXTREMELY"" slow.  The homework's do require some effort and time, but overall are not bad.  The final exam does not reflect what was learned.",10/11/2013,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,2,2.0,3,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,B,,person,people
