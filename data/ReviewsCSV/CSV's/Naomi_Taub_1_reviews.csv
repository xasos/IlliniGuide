Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,26473192,0,,good,5,RHET105,"She grades you way harder than any of the other Rhet 105 teachers, but it's well worth it. Papers are graded very harshly but she gives excellent feedback and advice. I've really improved my writing skills in this class.  Not a great discussion facilitator though, the in-class lectures weren't a real help in my writing.",05/05/2016,4,4.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people
Mandatory,average,good,average,0,25715371,0,,average,2,RHET105,A lot of reading for this class (basically every day). She is a very tough grader and she seems not knowing how to teach well. There are only three big assignments which are hard to get an A. You need to work hard for it.,12/15/2015,4,4.0,,3,Low,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
