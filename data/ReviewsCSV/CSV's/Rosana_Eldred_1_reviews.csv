It's ALGEBRA it should not be that hard, but yet she takes the LONGEST way to do problems, and on top of that MESSES them up!!!I wish I had went on this website before getting her as my TEACHER!She should go back to the drawing board and learn how to teach correctly!!!",08/31/2011,1,1.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She obviously doesn't care if you understand something, and she has a policy of not answering questions in discussion sections. And no, I'm not kidding.

N/A,good,average,good,0,15993190,0,,good,4,MATH125,"She did not have much control over the class setup cause she was just the head TA. When she did write the tests they were better than the other professor's. Started out mumbling a lot, but she quickly got better and seemed more comfortable. Class improved and she became a better teacher as time went on. Overall, not too bad",06/25/2009,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,average,poor,0,13486079,0,,poor,1,MATH181,"She is a complete and total scatterbrain. Material that should've been easy to learn was somehow made difficult through her inane and disorganized rambling. Didn't use a textbook, which is odd for a math class. Made mistakes on assignments, WITHIN PROBLEMS, all the time, which made them impossible to solve correctly. Terrible, and decidedly not hot",09/21/2007,3,3.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
