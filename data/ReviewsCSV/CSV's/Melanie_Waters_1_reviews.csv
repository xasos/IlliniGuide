Spanish isn't easy but she's the course director and I highly recommend taking Spanish with her instead of with one of her TAs.

There are only two tests and they're pretty straight forward, aside from a 50 word essay on each. The rest of the class is done on-line. I would take her if you have to take Spanish.
