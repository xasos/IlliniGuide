Mandatory,average,average,average,0,25953374,0,,good,3,MCB250,"Dr. Shankland is a very friendly guy but his lectures were difficult to stay with. You don't need to take any additional notes because his powerpoint slides have all the material you need to know for exams on them, and while this is a good thing it also means that his lectures feel very long and dry. Exams were fair and to the point. No tricks.",01/17/2016,3,3.0,,4,It's my life,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,24763414,0,,good,5,MCB250,Great lecturer. Exams are fair and based on the notes.   Reading is more supplementary than required (other than required to answer prelecture questions). Homework and quizzes are done online through MasteringBiology. Would definitely take another class with Marty.,05/07/2015,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
