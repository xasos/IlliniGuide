His papers can be a little tough but if you read up on all the assignments and are prepared to discuss them in class, you'll be good to go!

Expect quite a bit of essays, but also expect to learn a lot at the same time. Like all writing professors, he prefers a certain style. Once you find that style, you'll do just fine.",06/22/2010,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
