Her lectures are boring, she has a thick accent, and babbles a lot. But overall she's a good teacher. You get two excused absences for the semester, every absence after that she subtracts a third of a letter grade.",12/08/2015,1,1.0,,5,Low,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

I know multiple times people were too hungover to do their speeches and she let them wait until a day they were ready to do it. She truly cares about her students and your grade.
