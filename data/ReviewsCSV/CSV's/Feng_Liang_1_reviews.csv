Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,26198581,0,,good,5,STAT542,It's a joy for my life to know such an EXTREMELY smart and nice professor. She is also a very easy grader as long as you work reasonably hard (more than 80% of the class get at least A-) and respect her.,03/29/2016,4,4.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Grading is somewhat slow, and the professor appears disorganized in this regard.  One semester, I didn't get my grade until a month after the semester ended.

The problem was I was already barely passing this class before the unit assigned to this professor (this is a team taught course) and her poorly explained lectures were no help when attempting to keep my C.,05/12/2015,5,5.0,,3,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

The things in the homework are not explained in class, so if you take this course, you'll have to study everything by yourself. A strong background in R is required, since she doesn't teach it but the level of programming in hw is quite hard (esp. when you have to study the whole concepts at the same time).",09/13/2014,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,person
