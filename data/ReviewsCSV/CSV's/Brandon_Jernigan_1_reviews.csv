Not a hard grader per say, but then again we've done mostly short stories so far.

We watched horror films and critiqued them by looking at sexism, racism, femininity, gender roles, music, etc.  I have improved my writing skills immensley and i definately feel more prepared for future english classes or writing in the profession.
