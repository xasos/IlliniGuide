N/A,good,average,good,0,17496466,0,,good,5,MUS102,I knew right from the start that she was different from other teachers. In our 50+ student lecture she knew everyone's name after the first week. She made sure everybody understood the material by holding lots of office hours and addressing every question. I wish more than anything that she could have gotten tenure; she deserves it most.,08/10/2010,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I have never had a professor go the extra miles she does day in and day out to make sure that each student in a 100 student lecture is understanding material. She is wonderful at teaching, extremely wonderful at playing piano, and beyond wonderful as a person.",05/09/2009,4,4.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
