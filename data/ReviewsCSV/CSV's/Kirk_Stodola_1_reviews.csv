N/A,average,good,average,0,26694110,0,,poor,2,NRES511,Unorganized. Forgot things on the syllabus schedule several times (including an exam). Grading criteria and expectations were not clear. Class questions about assignments were dismissed as not a preferred teaching method or put off to get to in later classes. Lectures were not well presented. Course content was better from the textbook alone.,06/05/2016,4,4.0,,2,N/A,2,2.0,1,Yes,No,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people

I was a little lost at first, but once I reached out with questions, he was amazingly helpful.  The structure was a little sideways to me, but it ultimately worked out well.

I felt compelled to be the first one to list him because of how poorly this class has been structured and managed. Fully a third of the current class feels this way. Expectations are unclear, which makes it hard to succeed. Further, requests for info or direction are not met.",03/31/2014,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,person,people
