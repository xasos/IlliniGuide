I also took Dr. Hughes Anth 456 osteology class that was amazing. You practice on real bones and even though it is a challenging course, you become so interested and absorbed in her class that you find yourself learning all the material with ease.",01/24/2014,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Plus, she's an actual Forensic Anthropologist, so she knows her stuff.  Definitely recommend her if you're at all interested in forensics.",11/01/2012,2,2.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
