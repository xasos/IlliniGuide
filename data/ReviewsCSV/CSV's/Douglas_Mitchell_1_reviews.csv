N/A,good,good,good,0,24837378,0,,good,4,CHEM436,Prof Mitchell is helpful. I'll give him full credit for that. But you need to put in a lot of extra work outside of what's covered in class if you want to do well. He covers so much material and the lectures feel rushed.,05/15/2015,5,5.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Mandatory,good,good,good,0,24463862,0,,good,5,CHEM436,"CHEM 436 covers a lot of material. However, Mitchell covers everything you need to know for the exams in lecture. Very clear and concise presentation of material. Sometimes he glosses over details in drawing mechanisms and steps become difficult to follow. However, it's clear that he makes an effort to help students succeed.",03/15/2015,4,4.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,Not sure yet,,people,people

I've never had classes as unorganized as this. Essentially each exam he tells you ""you need to know everything"" when you don't, but it can be tough to decipher what he finds as important.",05/11/2013,3,3.0,,4,Low,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
