Not Mandatory,average,good,average,2,26294237,0,,average,2,MATH231,"Overall, I would say that this class was a Marathon, which I largely had to run on my own. If you go into office hours, he does displays a willingness to assist students. However, his lectures are often confusing, and mainly delve into general theory, rather than examples that may be presented on the exams. In short, decent guy, impossible teacher.",04/14/2016,4,4.0,,3,N/A,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
