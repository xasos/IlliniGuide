N/A,poor,good,poor,0,17298076,0,,poor,1,POLS427,"PS is not known for its great teaching, but even Wendy Tam is a disappointment. She lectures unintelligibly from withered yellow notes from her own grad school courses, often copying them directly to the blackboard without explanation. She is rude and abusive to students, and avoids office hours like the plague. You deserve better than her.",06/03/2010,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

This was a required stats course for graduate political science students and very few of us learned anything.  She made fun of us, graded capriciously, and never held office hours.",10/06/2003,5,5.0,,1,N/A,1,1.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Got the material the next term in a statistics class that was a lot better.",09/02/2003,4,4.0,,1,N/A,1,1.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Class was easy because I had the material in other classes, but this teacher is just bad.  Take 270 from someone else if possible.",09/02/2003,2,2.0,,1,N/A,1,1.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
