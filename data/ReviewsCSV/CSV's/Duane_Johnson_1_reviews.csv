If you ask him a question, he usually responds with &quot;Well we did this in class.&quot; I used the book a ton, but that didn't help much b/c he &quot;taught&quot; more from his powerpoint notes, which he thinks of as perfect and a godsend. Also grades are very low. Try Shim instead",11/05/2008,5,5.0,,2,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,average,good,poor,0,10561721,0,,poor,2,MSE406,He definitely should NOT be teaching undergrads.  He teaches the class at a level more suitable for grad students who have had several courses in the mechanics of materials and have completed the requisite math.  Not to mention he talks down to undergrads and never has time for anyone.,10/07/2005,5,5.0,,1,Low,1.5,1.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
