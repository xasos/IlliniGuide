N/A,good,average,good,0,3393617,0,,good,5,CHEM312,Professor Shapley is a great teacher. She does an excellent job with her lectures. The person with the above comment is foolish. They probably recieved a poor grade due to their own ignorance and that is why they insult the instructor. She makes inorganic chemistry very interesting.,02/25/2005,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,average,poor,1,3379921,0,,poor,1,CHEM312,"First of all this class is mind-numbingly boring. Second, she seems to be not very proficient in her field.  She makes a lot of mistakes and gives wrong answers to questions.  In addition, she makes the class play this idiotic game before which the entire class groans. You think she'd get the hint.",02/21/2005,2,2.0,,2,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
