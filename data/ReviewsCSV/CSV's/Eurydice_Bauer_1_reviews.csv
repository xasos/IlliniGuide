Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,25115462,1,online,poor,1,CI446,Her expectations are unclear.  Gives the rubric for projectspapers the day they are due or the day before. Takes forever to grade things and provides no feedback. Assigns an absurd amount of reading. Rude when you ask questions. Summer term ended 6 days ago and we still don't have final grades. Truly the worst professor I have had. ,08/12/2015,4,4.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,person,people

She assigns MUCH more work than the other two professors I have had for online courses.  She also assigns random arbitrary deadlines, which takes away one of the main points for taking an online class: flexibility!

Dr. Bauer openly challenged our class and claimed we were not suited to be educators.
