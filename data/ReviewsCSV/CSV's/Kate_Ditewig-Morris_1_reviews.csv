HMM what to say, she's cool just make sure you talk with her and build some type of relationship. In all my years of college writing she was the first to say I needed a workshop like whaaa? but Just play along you're sure to get an A.",12/13/2015,2,2.0,,4,Meh,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,average,1,24513625,0,,good,4,CMN211,Good teacher that cares about students. Takes the grading too seriously but then ends up giving almost everybody A's. Sometimes hard to pay attention to her lecturespresentations. Sometimes she's too serious about stupid things like technology use. And if you sit at the front and talk a lot she'll love you she def has favorites.,03/28/2015,2,2.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person

Way too much lecturing, not enough application, I think the projects are too much and she says how important being concise is on papers and public speaking but her lectures indicate she could take that advice herself! Also no computers allowed which is unfair. ",10/03/2014,1,1.0,,4,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,person,people

I think CMN211 IS AWESOME for communication majors who almost thought of majoring in business, but didn't for whatever reason. I think the assignments are going to be amazing especially the resume/interviews/job stuff!",09/05/2014,4,4.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
N/A,average,poor,average,1,23310571,1,,good,3,CMN211,Very easu grader but she has relatively high expectations. Makes you dress up for presentations but this class helps you get a better resume. My only beef is I wish there was more discussions and less listening to Kate lecture. Word of warbing: turn off your phone! If she sees you texting she'll hate you for the rest or the semester :/,05/25/2014,1,1.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,person,person
