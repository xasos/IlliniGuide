N/A,good,average,good,0,20406240,1,,good,5,IB452,Dr. Hu is an excellent teacher who has high but reasonable standards.  You probably won't like his class if you are not motivated to learn.  His lectures are all extremely informative and well-organized.  He does NOT have a thick accent at all.  In fact I was impressed by his flawless English.,06/12/2012,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

Dr. Hu is a great professor, is incredibly intelligent, is NOT hard to understand, and the class does teach EXCELLENT information in the topic of Ecosystem Ecology. This class was great, not too difficult, and I learned a lot. Never read the text book but will keep it for a resource.",12/17/2011,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,16866307,0,,good,5,IB452,I would have to disagree with previous comments. I took his course this past fall and found the course very interesting and engaging. His accent is not very thick at all. I even have bad hearing and there was never a point when I did not understand him. He is also one of my advisors and I have found him nothing other than approachable.,03/11/2010,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
