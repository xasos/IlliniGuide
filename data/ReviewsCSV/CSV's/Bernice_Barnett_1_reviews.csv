Although she often gets off on tangents, she truly caters to her students (though material may be a bit unclear). Lots of videos, so class can sometimes get a bit stale, but her bubbly personality and her general optimism will keep you coming to class.

I enjoyed it and liked her as a professor. Doesn't let you stay after to ask question. Takes weeks to respond to emails. Lots of extra credit on exams. She takes up a ton of time talking in circles though. ",12/09/2015,2,2.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

If you are interested in the 1960s then this is a class for you. She seems to be stuck in the past and almost all of the material we use in class is outdated.
