Hackbarth is a very nice person, however, in order for her to hear you out (in a grading situation), use the discussion board, meet her outside out of class, etc. Just keep up with the weekly quizzes and thoroughly read the the readings AND ASK QUESTIONS on them in order to perform well on the exams because they are a good % of grade.",12/29/2011,1,1.0,,1,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
