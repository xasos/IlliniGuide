N/A,poor,poor,poor,1,21151971,0,,poor,1,PS300,"Very arrogant, rude, and condescending to students and to the university. He bragged in class about how he was going to leave for a better university.

N/A,average,good,average,0,18020990,0,,poor,2,PS3,Pompous. Exams were horrible. Expect to write 10+ pages for your midterm and final. How he grades is extremely inconsistent and indicative of an arrogant close-minded professor. Are all Stanford Ph.Ds like this&#63; Look his performance up from Pittsburgh- apparently he was really horrible there too.,12/22/2010,5,5.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
