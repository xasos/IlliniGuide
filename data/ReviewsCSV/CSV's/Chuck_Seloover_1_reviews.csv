N/A,good,poor,good,0,13865291,0,,good,4,AVI200,Chuck is alot of fun in class. He is pretty clear with the material and will help explain hard stuff really well. Fun guy to interact with and makes class enjoyable. Kind hard on checkrides/orals but passable. Overall a really great guy. Tests are very easy and same with quizes.
