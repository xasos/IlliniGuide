I could tell he didn't like me because I was the type of student striving for an A instead of taking substance out of the course. I tried very hard (had my speeches memorized), met with him outside of class and he would not give me better than an A- on a speech.  He ruins SPCM 101's reputation of an easy-A class.",10/28/2008,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The only drawbrack is that the speeches are back to back, with little time in between, but i encourage people to take this class. even if you don't like public speaking, if you follow directions its an easy class to pass",11/13/2007,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
