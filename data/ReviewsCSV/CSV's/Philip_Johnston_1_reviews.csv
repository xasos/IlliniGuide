Mandatory,good,poor,good,1,22790190,0,,good,4,DANCE100,I was expecting to dance. We rolled around on the floor and massaged each other literally the entire time. It was awkward and boring. But the quizzes are insanely easy (i memorized the study guide while walking to class and got 100% on all of them) and same with exams.

It was definitely an easy A though. Study guides are given for the weekly reading quiz and the midterms. You also have to attend 6 performances, which can be slightly annoying.",05/06/2013,1,1.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

Tops like 5 questions per quiz and he sends you the study guide so you can pass! Honestly one of my favorite classes, it relaxes me so much, and I also enjoyed the shows very much! I recommend everyone to take it:)",11/14/2012,2,2.0,,3,It's my life,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

Also, the cost of watching performances is $10-$20 and you have to watch 5-6 of them. He gives a lot of extra credit, so don't worry. Take this class if you can!",08/05/2010,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
