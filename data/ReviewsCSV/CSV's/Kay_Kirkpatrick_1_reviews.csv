She had surgery mid-semester, so I got to experience some of the other profs as well. She is by far the most easy and understandable. I get the feeling that other profs are significantly harder and cover much more material. PS, this is a late posting.

Exams are just like homework problems and are fair and not too hard. Just try to sit near the front as she speaks somewhat quietly (especially if you take people talking into account).
