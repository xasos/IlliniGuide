Mandatory,good,average,good,1,26587879,0,,good,5,ACE222,Stoddard is by far the best professor I've had at UIUC.  He's a very funny guy and keeps everyone engaged during lecture.  I would almost consider him more of a life coach than a professor but I learned a lot in the classes I've taken with him.  I would vote for him as President if he ran.,05/16/2016,2,2.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,person

He also uses class time to talk about non-class stuff, which is always needed in lectures. Tests are straightforward from the powerpoints he gives. But, I'm not a real big fan of how he makes the powerpoints, but otherwise, it's a good ACE elective to take.",12/12/2008,2,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
