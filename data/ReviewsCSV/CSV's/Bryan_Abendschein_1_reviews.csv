N/A,good,poor,good,0,24021915,0,,good,5,CMN111,Bryan is the best. He is so understanding and friendly. You can come to him with a problem and he will work through it with you. I always found myself really engaged in his lectures. He is so hilarious and energetic. He gives really constructive feedback and you can tell that he's really into the class.
