N/A,poor,average,poor,0,11831986,0,,poor,1,HIST100,"This TA is the worst TA I have ever had.  She assigns awful busy-work assignments.  She is a harsh grader and doesn't explain why she takes off points in essays. Expects way to much in terms of what one can do during a one test. On top of this, she has ridiculous requirements, and will rudly lecture you in front of others if you do something wrong.",05/05/2006,3,3.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
