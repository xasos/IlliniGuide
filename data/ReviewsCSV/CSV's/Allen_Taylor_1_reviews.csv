N/A,good,average,good,0,19364547,0,,good,4,ARCH452,"Very practical guy. Gives you the information you need. Very relevant examples that are easy to follow for the homework and tests are not tricky. He lets you write your own equation sheet, so you get one 8.5x11 page to write whatever you want on for each test. Great job with what could have been a pretty boring class.",12/02/2011,2,2.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
