He was also very helpful during office hours.  The class was relatively easy; grades were based on 3 papers and 3 exams.  Although attendance is not mandatory, reading the book is definitely necessary to do well on the exams.",12/04/2009,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He seems to not only care about what he is teaching, he is also very knowledgeable and not wary of giving a helping hand to those in need.  His Intro to Experimental Psychology is a must for anyone; even those who have no interest in Psychology (i was one of them) it may change your mind otherwise.  Great class, great teacher.",11/02/2009,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

If you know your stuff, you'll ace the tests and he also curves all 3. One of my favorites so far..",01/15/2009,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
