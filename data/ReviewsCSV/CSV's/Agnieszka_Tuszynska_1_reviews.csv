N/A,average,average,average,0,18688259,0,,average,3,RHET105,Boring class. Discussions mainly focused on artwork from the book and sometimes one class period focused on just one picture or poem. Paper topics were too broad and only centered around art. So you could pick anything from a book to a picture or song. No group papers in this class. Other classes did group work. Class is easy if you like writing.,06/01/2011,3,3.0,,3,Meh,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Do not take unless you like analyzing &quot;Art.&quot; The textbook is used every week with long discussions. The class bored me to death.

Her assigned readings do a decent job of stimulating intellectual conversations in class. Small group discussions are the only times everyone is required to participate, and these do not occur often so have no fear if you do not like speaking in class. Overall, a good experience.",05/01/2010,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
