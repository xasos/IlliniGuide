Tests are very difficult due to the lack of many helpful example problems and because no partial credit is given.

He'll always stop to make a point clear if someone doesn't understand, and he posts just about everything online all the time.

He might be a little over-caffeinated, but at least that keeps the lectures entertaining (tells lots of jokes).  Also, he must be at least 6'7&quot;, so he really maximizes his use of the blackboard.
