Mandatory,good,average,good,3,26272383,0,,good,4,IB202,"Sears is a prototypical professor. She is positive, knowledgeable, and doesn't curveball you during exam time. My only criticism of her is that her slides can often be a bit tricky/messy to go back to when its exam-study time. Beware of labs; if you get a harsh TA like I did, that much worse than anything Sears can do to you. Lotta clicker points.",04/11/2016,2,2.0,,4,N/A,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,B+,,people,people

Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,22894399,1,,good,5,IB360,She is a very smart teacher. Can explain very well. Very clear. Class is structured great so that half of the lectures are online.

N/A,good,poor,average,0,21199379,1,,good,4,IB360,"Super easy class. Go to class and do the online lectures/quizzes, and you're basically going to get an A. None of her questions come from the textbook so don't get it. However, I felt like a 2nd grader with the way she talked and treated the class. I would never take another one of her classes again.
