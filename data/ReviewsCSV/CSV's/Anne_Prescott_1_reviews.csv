Although occasionally boring, lecture was helpful for pinpointing the specific exam material. TA sections are  somewhat annoying and unnecessary but sadly mandatory.",07/15/2009,1,1.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

This is one of those courses that's so ridiculously boring it's actually difficult. I could've gotten an A, but ended up with a B because I couldn't even bring myself to study for exams. That said, a B without studying is pretty nice.",04/26/2009,2,2.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Just memorize the stuff in the book and focus on the culture aspects of each country. DO NOT take discussion with Renee Gordon!!

I pretty much skipped lecture and went to discussion only and got by.
