He does not give you any practice exams or does not prepare you well for exams at all.  He says study everything which is virtually impossible to do.

Exams can be a little tricky and may be a little algebra heavy, but he gives out points based for the most part on the concepts, so algebra mistakes don't hurt you too badly. Highly recommend him for 251.",12/23/2010,2,2.0,,4,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Exams, however, are brutal: overly complicated questions that require lots of symbolic algebra that's way too easy to screw up.  From what I've heard, Gioia's exams are much more straightforward.  Take him for 251 if you can.",11/27/2010,4,4.0,,3,Low,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
