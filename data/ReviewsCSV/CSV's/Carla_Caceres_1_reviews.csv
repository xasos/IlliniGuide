N/A,good,average,good,0,22258335,0,,good,5,IB449,She is clearly passionate about her work.  She makes the subject matter fun and interesting.  I recommend taking 449 with the lab because it makes understanding the material that much easier without a ton of extra work.  There is an independent research project for lab but it is completely manageable.,11/05/2013,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I came to tell her this after class, and she said I made her day and then invited me to walk with her to her office. She researches Daphnia. She's such a personal and gifted professor.

N/A,good,good,good,0,20765598,0,,good,5,IB477,Carla is a truly gifted professor. She cares so much about teaching in a real way. She'd let us use our notes AND the internet on exams because she says that in our career we will have those tools available and that is what she is training us for. Best Professor I've had. Go to office hours and you will earn excellent marks in her classes.,11/01/2012,4,4.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,poor,good,0,11255352,0,,good,5,IB105,"Very easy to understand. Gives extra- credit every two weeks for showing up to class. Remember that she ALWAYS gives extra credit the next class after an exam. And she gives extra credit right before breaks...times when most people don't show up. But lecture extra-credits are only worth 1 point, not 2 like the tests. An easy A if you try.",12/24/2005,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
