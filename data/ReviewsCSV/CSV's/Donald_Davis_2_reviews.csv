N/A,good,good,good,0,16588088,0,,good,4,FIN230,I was pretty sure I would have scored a B+ for this class because of my sucky second midterm. Turns out I got an A! Which shows how this class may seem tough but isn't at all. The stuff you learn is very informative and useful. Definitely not something you'd discard right after the semester.,12/17/2009,4,4.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,average,1,15285202,0,,good,4,FIN230,Class is pretty interesting.  Not too difficult if you take the time to actually read the policies and don't just look for HW answers.  The HWs are hard but definitely prepare you for the exams.  If you go to class and do the HW and projects you will get an easy B.,12/27/2008,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
N/A,average,good,average,0,15180356,0,,average,3,FIN230,"The class itself is difficult but it's a class where homework, projects, and participation(I-cickers) make up about 50% of the grade so you can do bad on the tests but still end up okay. Plus, he curves the class at the end, so it's not too bad. Also, he allows you to use your notes on exams. Overall, a nice teacher who gets the students.",12/12/2008,4,4.0,,3,Meh,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,13977322,0,,poor,1,FIN321,"Prof. was fun and nice, but grading was unfair.  Case studies were confusing, and teacher wasn't good about clearly answering questions.  I had no idea what to study for the exams, in the end there was a curve though.  However, I would advise taking another teacher even if the alternative is harder cause you'd at least know where you stand.",01/10/2008,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
