He has office hours almost every day, and if he doesn't he can almost always make time to meet in person or promptly respond to emails.

All the negative comments are because some people are clearly frustrated by the ME program here and don't understand the point of a design class that is very open ended unlike ME 170.,09/29/2011,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,3,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
