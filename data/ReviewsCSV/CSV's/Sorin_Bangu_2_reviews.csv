For you grammar freaks out there, he misspells/leaves out words which is kind of absurd to me, but that's just me. There's no philosophical debates and he doesn't explain well. I never, EVER want to go to class because I just fall asleep. The mandatory attendance is a definite killer.",12/10/2010,4,4.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
