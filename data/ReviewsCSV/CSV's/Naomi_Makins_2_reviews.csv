The subject itself was interesting, but pretty hard for me. However, if you go to office hours, she'll help you through every, single homework problem, if needed, and that allows you to easily get an A.

N/A,good,average,good,0,15608392,0,,good,5,PHYSHO,She's easily the best professor I've had at this university. Tough concepts I was struggling with even before this class now make sense to me. She really knows what she's doing and she's hilarious on top of that so it's a ton of fun to go to class. Plus if you go to office hours she'll work with you until you figure out the problems.,04/05/2009,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,12833077,0,,good,5,PHYS212,Naomi was probably the best and most enthusiastic professor I will ever have.

N/A,good,good,good,0,13248823,0,,good,5,PHYS212,Naomi was a very enthusiastic and decent prof. Focused more on actually teaching than reading from the Powerpoint. Did a lot of problem working on the board. Make sure to go to class and don't sit in back—there's no magnified projection of the board.  Go to class and office hours and you'll be fine.
