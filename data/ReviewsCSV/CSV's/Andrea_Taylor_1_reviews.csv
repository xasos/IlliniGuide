The number of articles may seem unreasonable at first, but as the course goes on it gets A LOT easier. We have four blogs to write which took me about 20 minutes each....we meet via Elluminate once a week and have weekly one page summaries that we do in groups and one project as the final.",10/31/2012,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

We have weekly assignments that are very easy, and each week you'll get faster at the assignments. She's a very easy grader and there are no quizzes or tests!
