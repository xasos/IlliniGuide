Mandatory,average,good,average,0,22692609,0,,average,3,ASTR100,SO MUCH INFORMATION. For a 100 level course information was broad and the test questions were concise. Need to go to class for iclickers. Class dragged and no one pays attention. Super easy to get a B in the class but impossible to get an A. I got 50% on both exams and still got a B.,01/03/2014,5,5.0,,3,Meh,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

So tests are pretty difficult and worth a lot (40% for each test) but he curves them a bunch. Out-of-class activities give you easy 5% extra   credit for the class.
