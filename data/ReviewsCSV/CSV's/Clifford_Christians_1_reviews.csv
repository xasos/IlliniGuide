The class doesn't even require that much work. However, his way of speaking is too convoluted. He doesn't talk; He gives speeches. He doesn't have an accent, but I found it impossible to pay attention or understand anything he said all semester.",05/07/2012,3,3.0,,3,Low,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
