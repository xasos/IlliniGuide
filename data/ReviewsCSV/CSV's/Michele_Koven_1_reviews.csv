Not much care is given in being specific in project rubrics. In our final paper rubric she wrote we should structure our paper according to ""FAIRLY specific guidelines."" Such as? Enough said.

N/A,average,average,average,0,21558541,1,,average,2,CMN232,This teacher is knowledgeable.  This class is not for seniors the amount of reading each night is around 30 pages (which is a lot of a 200 level class).  The exams are straight forward but if you don't read or pay attention you will know absolutely nothing for them. I thought this class was more about culture but is all about language use.,04/18/2013,3,3.0,,3,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

I devote more time to reading for this low level 200 class than i do for a lot of my 400 levels. She is a very kind person but very inflexible about her schedule.
