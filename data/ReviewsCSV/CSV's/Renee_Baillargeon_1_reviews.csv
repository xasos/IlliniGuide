Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,25163451,0,,good,5,PSYC216,She's really sweet. And she's done amazing research. I feel ridiculously fortunate to have had her as a professor. Class is not difficult. Show up to class with lecture slides printed out and write down any extra information she may say. That's all you have to do. I got over 100 in the class because it was so easy. Tests are all multiple choice.,08/31/2015,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people

Lectures are clear and concise, and exams are straightforward (although you'll definitely need to study). Pro tip: attendance isn't mandatory, but sometimes on days when few people show up she will give a hint about an exam question. Really a brilliant lady and a very interesting course.

She explains everything slowly and clearly so basically you dont even have to read the textbook. Everything is well-organized. Super nice and experienced ! P/S: she says ""thank you"" in a very cute way with a  very strong Quebec accent. It's a must to listen to that!",05/10/2014,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
