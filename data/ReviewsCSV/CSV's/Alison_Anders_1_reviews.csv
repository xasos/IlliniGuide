Often flustered and the slides are sometimes unorganized and even incorrect. I understand she wants you to think outside the box, but for an intro Geology class, it's extremely difficult. The tests are insanely hard, even after preparing for them for many hours.",05/04/2016,4,4.0,,2,N/A,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,people,people

She also lets you work in groups for part of the exams, which are not terribly difficult. Attendance is mandatory in the sense that there are in-class assignments during about a third of the lectures, which count for a small fraction of your final grade.",07/04/2013,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Test material was divided pretty graciously and if you go to her, she is enthusiastic to help. Not a technical course. Read your chapter over before class, and it will be easy. If you aren't interested in science/environment or how things work, it will be boring sometimes. Lab is easy.",04/12/2013,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
