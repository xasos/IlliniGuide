Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,25596266,0,,poor,1,ANTH103,"Probably one of the most boring professors ever. If you look around the class, EVERYONE is on their computers doing something else. Greenberg can't form a logical sentence, seriously nothing coming out of her mouth makes ANY sense which makes lectures pointless. The amount of reading is ridiculous and the midterms/final make NO sense. DO NOT TAKE!!",12/08/2015,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,C+,,people,people

Nobody ever knew what she was taking about and the midterm and final were basically your whole grade. The test questions don't make sense either.

So if you got a 93.4, you get an A-. Paper was graded very unfairly by Ta's so I ended up getting an A-. I should've gotten a 4.0 if it wasn't for this class.

N/A,average,good,average,2,22664212,0,,poor,2,ANTH103,She wants you to work as hard for a gen-ed as you would for a required class. Grading is very harsh and there is no curve. Does not post lecture slides online. 94+ is an A. There was a 3 page paper that was 25% of the grade. The grading was so bad that she eventually had to add 10 points for everyone.

Mandatory,average,good,average,1,22575835,1,,average,2,ANTH103,Professor Greenberg's lectures tend to be very boring and complex. She can tangent off a topic and you end up getting lost in what she's talking about. She accompanies the textbook with A TON of supplemental articles that are tested on the midterm and final.

Doesn't post up lectures on line so you have to take notes in class every time. Not a good speaker. Grade scale is unreal. She emailed 94 is an A so 93 is an A-. I don't know if she changed this recently but that's just ridiculous. Does not respond to emails promptly.,12/04/2013,4,4.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
