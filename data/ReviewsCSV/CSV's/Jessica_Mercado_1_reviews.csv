Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,23434947,1,,poor,1,ENGL208,"Horrible professor. Very tough grader, although comments made no sense. Didn't learn anything throughout the entire class. I was extremely disappointed since I was very interested in Victorian literature prior to this class, now I hate it. Picked bad poems to read, and assignments were unnecessarily long. Paper prompts weren't clear. STAY AWAY!!!!!",07/09/2014,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,B,,person,people

Eng 109 is introduction to fiction, and she does an excellent job of teaching students how to effectively pull meaning from the texts we read. Reading is required for every class, attendance is mandatory, although you get a few excused absences. You have to work for your grade, but it is definitely worth it.",04/17/2013,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I got C for the first paper, B- the second. If u expect a easy class, don't choose this one.",10/23/2012,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

There are five 600 word poetry responses and 2 4-6 page essays (in addition to the mid-term and final, in which you have to remember an entire catalouge of poetry, the authors, and the content). Looking for an easy class, please don't take this one.",05/10/2012,3,3.0,,3,Low,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
