N/A,poor,average,poor,3,22780567,0,,poor,1,MATH424,Sowers' class was the worst class I've had at UIUC. He had no plan for the class and made it up as he went along. We didn't cover the material that one expects to learn in real analysis. The whole experience was a waste of my time and money and its a disgrace that the math dept. has so little oversight over their courses.,01/22/2014,3,3.0,,2,It's my life,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
