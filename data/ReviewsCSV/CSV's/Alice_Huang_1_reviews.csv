She tries to make things as easy as possible - attendance is optional, and she posts the slides online. Additionally, in class participation can be made up online without penalty. Personally I enjoyed going to class as it is an interesting topic and she lets you out early about half of the time anyway.",04/25/2016,1,1.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,person
