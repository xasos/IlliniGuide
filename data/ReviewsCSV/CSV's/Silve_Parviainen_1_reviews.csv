She spends so much time speaking of the concepts, but doesn't use numberal examples at all. The problem sets have minimal guidance. She tries to be helpful, but usually isn't. She's nice, but a terrible professor. Lowest grade so far in college. Take someone else.",01/27/2008,5,5.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,11889869,0,,good,4,ECON302,"She is an excellent teacher.  There are six homeworks and two midterms, plus a comprehensive final.  Class is calculus based, must know partial derivaties (just basic calculus is sufficient).  She does not allow calculators, but her exam equations are very simple and do not require the use of one anyway.

The great thing is that the tests are graded to give you tons of partial credit, so just know how to set things up.  This class is Calculus based, not all the Econ 302s are. C or B should be no problem.",05/11/2005,4,4.0,,5,Meh,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
