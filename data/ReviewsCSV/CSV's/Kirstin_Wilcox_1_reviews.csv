N/A,good,poor,good,0,24840233,0,,good,5,ENGL199,"Kirstin Wilcox's course was easy. As long as you had your internship and did work in the internship, you were in the clear of receiving an A in the class. This course entails: cover letters, resume work etc. She only gives a bad grade if you did not do a portion of the assignment or put forth no effort.
