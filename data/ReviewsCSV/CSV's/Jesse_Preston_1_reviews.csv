Not Mandatory,good,average,average,0,26044619,0,,good,4,PSYC332,"Fairly tedious class. Professor wasn't enthusiastic, but I can't really blame her given how uninspiring the course content is. Exams are tricky, so don't underestimate them. No curve, either. The lab doesn't start consistently meeting until halfway through the semester. Some funny pop culture references in power points helped offset the material.",02/10/2016,2,2.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people
