N/A,good,good,good,0,21742571,1,,good,5,ACCY312,The class is very interesting and it is my favorite accounting class I have taken so far. She really knows her stuff and delivers knowledge very clearly. The class is tough and it is not a good idea to miss a class even the attendance is not required. Reading only the PPTs cannot help all the study.,05/12/2013,4,4.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

N/A,good,good,good,0,19561266,0,,good,4,ACCY312,This was my favorite class on campus. I learned so much in this class.  She used real life examples to explain complex concepts and encouraged participation so it was easy to pay attention.  I strongly encourage attending class and reading the book ahead of time.  This class requires a good deal of time.,12/18/2011,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,18368644,0,,good,4,ACCY312,"Skeptical after reading all of those comments of her playing favorites. Honestly, She is one of my favorite professors. She does have a somewhat mean sense of humor but she pokes fun at herself all the time, so don't take remarks too seriously. She is by far the most helpful professor I've had tho.",04/06/2011,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Plays favorites but class is really interesting. Top 20% get A's but getting lower than a B minus is tough to do.",12/17/2010,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

If you're not one of them, you won't get an A due to her grading policy (only top 20% of the class get As). All quizzes and exams are open book which is really nice.

She knows her stuff, explains very clearly, and makes sure to check the class' understanding before moving on. Attendance is not mandatory, but you'd be dumb not to go and try to learn the material yourself. Not an easy A, but you learn a lot!",12/31/2009,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
