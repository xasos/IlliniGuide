Not very helpful and can be dismissive when it comes to regrades due to bookTA error, but caves with enough persistence. Great online lecture notes. Definitely more theoretical than practical, lots of wave eqns and no lasers.",05/18/2015,2,2.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
