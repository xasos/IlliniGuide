N/A,good,average,good,0,18847345,0,,good,5,CHIN408,"This guy loves Chinese poetry. He can make a poem or text about the most dull topic the single most interesting thing you'll ever hear. It's been three years and I can still remember some of his more passionate lectures on poems. Go to class, bring your book, and be ready to recite, and he'll love you. Ask him to read stuff in Cantonese too.",07/25/2011,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He graded all my essays a full letter lower than I usually receive for comparable writing.  When I explained this to him and asked about extra credit, he told me I was insulting him.  I know other students in the class who had similar experiences with him.",07/12/2010,4,4.0,,2,Low,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
