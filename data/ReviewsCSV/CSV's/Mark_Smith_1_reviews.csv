Mandatory,good,average,good,1,25861297,0,,good,5,FIN300,Prof. Smith was the best professor I've had at U of I. He takes the time to get to know his students and really wants everyone to do well. Fin 300 is a lot of work no matter who you take it with but he does a great job explaining  the material so you are well prepared for the homework and exams. Would highly recommend.,01/02/2016,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,person
Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,25441557,2,,poor,1,FIN300,"Yeah. He was a terrible professor that often made the class uncomfortable.  He could not teach problems at all. Often he would speak very quickly as if to get through the material without any consideration for whether students were actually learning. Essentially, he was just a talking head. Would ramble frequently. ",11/18/2015,4,4.0,,1,It's my life,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people

His exams are pretty straightforward as they're based on the homework, pop quizzes, and problems he does in class. Just be aware Fin 300 requires a lot of work and is by no means an easy class but that is the same way no matter what professor you take.",05/11/2015,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

He never quizzes you on ""new"" material, always something he has gone over in class. The midterm was fair, and based off the the materials he gave us to study. He definitely wants his students to succeed!",04/20/2015,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person

Very straightforward and fair exam, nothing showed up that I wouldn't have predicted.

He will take time out of his day to help if needed. I had him during his first year and he still has some things to improve on, but you will not find another teacher that cares so much about each individual student on this campus.",12/17/2013,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
