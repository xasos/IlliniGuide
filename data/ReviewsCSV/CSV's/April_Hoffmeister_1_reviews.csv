Mandatory,good,poor,good,7,25586819,0,,good,5,MATH103117,"Dr. Hoffmeister is an amazing instructor.  I am not sure where these people come up with the idea that her exams are impossible.  You are attending a well-respected four year University, AND you are preparing to become educators yourselves.  Quit whining, grow up, and start acting like responsible adults and not spoiled little brats.  ",12/08/2015,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

She talks about her children a lot and incorporates what they are learning into our lessons. The class itself s incredibly tough. There are four exams and, so far, 2 of the 3 taken have been impossible. There is so much material, and it is never truly clear what to study.
