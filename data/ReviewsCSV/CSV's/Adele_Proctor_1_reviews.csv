N/A,good,good,good,1,15071664,0,,good,4,SPSHS300,Class of 1997.  Great mentor and professor.  Dr. Proctor was a great resource in SPSHS and served as a mentor for my Ronald McNair and SROP projects.  Can't say enough wonderful things about her.  Reading is essential. Critical thinking is a must.  And expectations are high!

Attendance is crucial to do well in this class since most of the material is covered in the almost 3hr class.

N/A,poor,average,poor,1,10939067,0,,poor,1,SHS320,Her tests are subjective and she can't even back her own answers up let alone explain them.
