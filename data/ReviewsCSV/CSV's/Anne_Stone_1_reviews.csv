N/A,good,poor,good,0,16445655,0,,good,4,CMN220,"Anne is extremely nice and helpful, and the class is relatively easy. She breaks down the overall writing requirement for the class into small, manageable assignments which I, for the most part, enjoyed. Lectures are boring, however, and she never seems terribly enthused to be teaching. Worst of all, you can't bring your laptop.",12/01/2009,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

There are a couple of exams, but as long as you do the reading and listen in class, you will be fine. She tells you exactly what to study for. Overall, great class.",04/08/2009,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,average,average,0,14000956,0,,good,3,SPCM323,Anne was a great teacher! If you do the readings before class and participate she will love you. There is only one test and it is straight memorization... study well and you'll do fine. Make sure you participate in the debates... she'll fail you if you don't. Otherwise if you write well there is no reason you shouldn't get an A in the class.,01/15/2008,2,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
