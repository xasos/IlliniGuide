It's hard to keep up with all the reading. I got off track really quick, but you're allowed to write your papers on ANY text during that period, not JUST the ones we read in class.

N/A,good,poor,average,0,15244088,0,,good,4,ENGL255,"Prof. Chai provides background information that some might find unnecessary, but I enjoyed the historical and biographical context. This class is easy (2 papers and 2 take home exams, more stuff depending on your TA). My only complaint was that Prof. Chai was removed from the students- not once in lecture did he ask for our opinions or input.",12/19/2008,1,1.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Anecdotes often find their way into his speech & are sadly often misread as drivel instead of elucidation.
