N/A,poor,good,average,0,12875269,0,,poor,1,MATH221,"Lectures were painfully dull and confusing. Instead of going through the types of problems you will see on homework and tests, he instead just did long, complicated proofs that had little to do with anything in lecture. Very disorganized and frequently late. Was slightly helpful during office hours, but I was already way beyond lost at that point.",02/21/2007,4,4.0,,3,Meh,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,poor,good,poor,0,12779299,0,,poor,1,MATH221,His lectures are awful and essentially pointless.

On top of that he takes a week vacation the week before the first test and leaves a TA that can barely speak english to teach the class for him. nice guy but not a professor for a person just starting calculus,09/21/2006,3,3.0,,2,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
