N/A,good,average,good,0,20333017,0,,good,4,CMN101,Kay is Great! She is really passionate about this class. She grades okay. But I really like her because she is extremely helpful in the sense of helping guide to towards getting an A.

N/A,good,poor,good,0,12343328,0,,good,5,SPCM101,Loved her. I think she was the only real teacher for the class; the rest are TAs. She makes the class really comfortable and all you have to do is follow the guidelines for the speech; really the only place you can get points off. Usually lets out early with T/Th classes. Take her over the rest if you can! You'll improve so much.,11/01/2006,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
