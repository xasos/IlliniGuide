It showed on his tests cause they were really confusing questions and they were usually worthless fragments.

Hes really knowledgeable and helpful.  you dont have to go to class if u look at the lectures online, do the hw, look at the previous exams before tests, and go to discussion.  Lots of extra credit.

Go to the labs and do the homework - and if you have trouble with it ask him, because he gives all the answers! Beware the TAs though, as you may have to work to understand the material on your own if you end up with a bad one.",01/20/2009,2,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,15269176,0,,good,5,PHYS140,"He knows his stuff, but, more importantly for the people looking up this stuff, PHYS 140 is really easy. Extra credit is abundant, a high portion of your grade is determined by doing weekly homeworks and attendance to &quot;labs&quot; once a week, and the tests aren't hard. Unlike other very easy gen eds, though, you'll probably actually learn some physics.",12/23/2008,1,1.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Attendance in lectures is required with IClickers and you just do silly experiments in lab.  Weekly homeworks that help boost grade. Exams are based on old exams that are posted online.
