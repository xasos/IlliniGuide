Teaches the material poorly and often incorrectly, and when confronted on the accuracy of what he has taught, gets very angry.  Thinks he's smater than all the students, but hes not even close.  Fun to make fun of him to his face without him realizing",12/07/2005,3,3.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
