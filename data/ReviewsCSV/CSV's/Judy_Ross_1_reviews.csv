Likes students to don't go with the flow, but create their own &quot;rules&quot; to the assignments, and don't necessarily stick to the &quot;rules&quot; given. She likes students that take risks with their work. Doesn't like under-achievers. DO YOUR WORK.",12/07/2007,4,4.0,,4,It's my life,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
