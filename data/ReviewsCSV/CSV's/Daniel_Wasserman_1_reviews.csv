Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24757804,0,,good,5,ECE329,"He's my favorite ECE professor by a long shot. He moves fast through lecture, but only so he can try to give you as much info as possible. Incredible at explaining things in a comprehensible way. He's an entertaining lecturer, and always tries to make himself available to his students",05/06/2015,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,22706793,0,,good,4,ECE340,"Wasserman is a godsend to the ECE department. He teaches very effectively, making very complicated concepts relatively easy to understand. He's also quite funny and sarcastic. Initially, he was not my lecturer, but I switched into his lecture and a sea of understanding washed over me. If you can, definitely go to his class.",01/06/2014,3,3.0,,5,Low,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A+,,people,people
