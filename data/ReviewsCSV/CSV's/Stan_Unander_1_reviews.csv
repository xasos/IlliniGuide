N/A,good,average,good,0,13865315,0,,good,4,AVI497,Class was pretty easy - presentations and guest speakers. Only 2 tests: 1 on FAR 121/135 and another on presentations and advanced systems and bot hare curved but the material is kind of hard to study for. Material is not difficult and there really isnt much there. He explains stuff well enough and is a fun guy in class to interact with.,12/18/2007,2,2.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
