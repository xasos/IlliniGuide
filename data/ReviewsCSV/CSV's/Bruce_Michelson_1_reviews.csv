Really makes his students think--he will not let you off the hook or let you slip by with an easy answer, and you will learn so much for it. Sharp wit. Might seem scary at first but he's an extremely compassionate teacher, gives thoughtful feedback on your writing and loves talking to students outside of class. He rocks.",08/08/2011,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

His theory seemed to be that we were too smart for mundane homework assignments.  There were a couple papers, but they weren't too difficult, and he isn't too harsh when grading.
