Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25861450,0,,good,5,ACCY304,"Easily one of the best professors I have had in the COB. Very engaged teacher, makes the material easier to process. Very much so tries to involve the students in the conversation, so it is up to you to participate which will help you do better in the class. A lot of memo writing, and a huge final project but that is consistent for Accy304.",01/02/2016,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,23603252,2,,good,2,ACCY304,Vance is the man.  He's a really chill guy.  ACCY 304 is not.  It's mostly just memo writing on a case every week and a discussion on it.  If you feel cheated on grading talk to him because he is very willing to re-look over stuff and mostly gives you more points.  Midtermfinal blow.  It's part multiple choice from the book and a few mini cases.,09/20/2014,4,4.0,,5,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

There is nothing you can learn by attending the class.",05/25/2014,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,B+,,people,people
