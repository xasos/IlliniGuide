N/A,good,average,good,2,20218930,0,,good,5,ME340,"Overall, a very nice guy. He definitely shows his interest in teaching the subject. The material can be hard at times, but he does his best to teach everything thoroughly. He is also very helpful in answering questions. Don't get the textbook though, the class is based entirely on notes taken in class (an incentive to attend).",05/07/2012,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
