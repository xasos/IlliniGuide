N/A,good,average,good,4,23131275,0,,good,5,MKTG461,Lan Chaplin is a great Professor! She takes her time explaining what is expected of you and gives you all the resources and help you need. She is very passionate about what she teaches and it shows through her lectures. The midterm is not easy but you can easily get an A if you study all her lecture slides. Final project assigned 1st day. Take it!,04/30/2014,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
