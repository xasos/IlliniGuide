Mandatory,good,good,good,0,26325615,0,,good,4,ACE306,"Very interesting material. My advice is to go to all classes, keep up on the readings, and see him in office hours if you have any questions. If you do these things, studying for the midterms should be a breeze, honestly.  Just review class notes and readings. Oh, and take more notes than what he puts on the slides.",04/19/2016,4,4.0,,4,N/A,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

He is extremely knowledgeable and has practiced intellectual property law in the area of food patents prior to teaching. Two quizzes with two parts each, take-home and in class. Both were very lengthy. Midterm was pretty tough for the entire class.

Reading is usually not required if you go to class. I would definitely go because the book is incredibly boring. Questions on the tests and quizzes are from lectures. The tests aren't too difficult and are curved.",05/08/2009,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
