Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25402979,0,,good,5,ENGL300,"Professor Nazar is excellent. She is extremely knowledgeable on her subject, and skilled in communicating that knowledge. My class was discussion based, and she has the perfect blend of facilitating discussion, allowing it to happen, and occasionally interjecting and lecturing on specific points. Helpful feedback, helpful office hours. Recommended!",11/12/2015,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24241728,0,,good,4,ENGL300,She's really interested in the material which really helps.  Some of the texts were very dense and difficult to slog through but others were pleasant surprises.  She teaches 18th century so if you take her class you should know what you're in for.  Participation really helps in this class as it does in all upper level English classes.,01/06/2015,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

She is extremely knowledgeable and very helpful, so make sure to ask her questions regarding the texts and their historical background. She is also very open to discussing essays and assignments.

Some of the material itself is pretty dense, but if you listen/participate to discussions there's some clarity.

N/A,good,good,good,0,20505050,0,,good,4,ENGL300,This was a 14 person class that was 2 hours long with heavy discussion. If you you didn't read you were basically called out since you really had nothing to say. There were only 2 papers which were about 30% and 40% of your grade which was both good and bad. She's really helpful with editing papers SO ASK HER!!! Otherwise she was very nice!,07/19/2012,4,4.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

But as the term went on, she seemed less interested and more annoyed with the class.  We had very few grades, and she grades papers harshly, so you really have to work hard on those grades.

She did take suggestions, but the problem is that it sometimes made it hard to know what SHE (really) wanted. I can see why some people consider her unfair, as her directions were not always clear and it felt sometimes like she was making up rules as she went along.

If you don't like something as a student, or think class is going at an unreasonable pace, tell her and she will adjust.
