N/A,good,average,good,0,20224875,0,,good,4,KIN140,"I had this class for sports in society. It was an interesting course. Exams are easy if you study the slides and read the chapter. The chapters are very long though. Also you get all lecture quiz points if you take the lecture quiz. Total of 50. Show up to discussion and you should get all points for that to. Overall, a very good class.",05/08/2012,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
