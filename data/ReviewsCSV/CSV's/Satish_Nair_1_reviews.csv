Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,24962700,0,,poor,1,MCB354,"Worst instructor I've ever had, and it's got nothing to do with how hard Biochem is. It appears his only job in teaching us was to read off lecture slides quickly and without explaining the relevant points. I can do that myself. He made frequent mistakes in lectures, discussion sheets, quizzes, and exams. Avoid Nair at all costs. Terrible. ",06/13/2015,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,C,,people,people

He makes tons of mistakes, not only on his keys but on lecture slides and tests (he used the wrong units so none of the answers were right). The discussion sheets are helpful but since my TA was clueless, prepare to teach yourself.",11/19/2014,5,5.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,average,0,23784526,0,,poor,1,MCB354,Dr. Nair stumbles over his words. He's not good at explaining concepts in class. I'm not sure about how he is in office hours. I will give him credit with how prompt he is in responding when you email him. His exams are hard but they are doable. Just do problem sets and really understand them. you can make it through this class I promise. ,11/11/2014,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Packs the slides full of way too much text and graphs  to where it's incredibly distracting from what he's actually saying. He just reads off the slides. Practice test and problem set keys are almost always completely wrong, making it even more difficult to study. Very poor teacher.

He made the 2nd test a 4 hour test crammed into 2 hours - after all, how dare we study so hard. Gives no examples on how to do problems, and he is more concerned about a certain grade distribution than us learning",11/06/2013,5,5.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The first exam average was high (A-), so he got angry and made the second exam much more difficult (average 51%).
