N/A,good,average,good,1,24302847,0,,good,4,ACCY302,"Lectures are pretty good, but the pace is fast. She convey concepts clearly and the power points are posted so you can review things you don't understand. The book also is helpful in this class. Only two tests so try to do well on the first one. Overall, I'd say she is one of the best professors in the College of Business. ",01/18/2015,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person
Mandatory,good,average,good,0,23690093,0,,good,4,ACCY302,"I like her even though she can be a bit bland. Her lectures are fast paced and can be confusing (her accent doesn't help) but if you ask her to explain something after class, she's very nice about it and extremely helpful. Class is straightforward and if you study the material, you should be fine. I expect I'll get a B+ or A- in this class.

N/A,average,good,average,1,17766554,1,,good,3,ACCY302,"Even though I am in her 8am class, time passes by quickly because of the way she teaches--lectures for 15-20 minutes, does an activity related to what she just lectured, and then repeat until class is over. On days in which we turn in our memos, we get out of class after discussing the memo, which usually takes about half an hour.
