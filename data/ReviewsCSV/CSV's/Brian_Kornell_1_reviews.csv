Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,22443556,0,,poor,1,ENG121,He is HORRIBLE. Only talks about SOCIAL issues that HE thinks is important. I have only received one graded paper back and we are finished with the semester. He is awful. I have to take advanced comp next year and am so unprepared because of him.

N/A,average,average,average,0,15674957,0,,poor,3,CW104,Quite possibly the worst TA I've ever had. He grades stories on whether he likes them or not without any regard to your style. He constantly makes up stupid rules like &quot;from now on you can't use exclamation marks&quot;. If he hadn't given me an A in the class I would have gone to his office and raised hell.
