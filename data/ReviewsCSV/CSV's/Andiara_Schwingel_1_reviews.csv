If you try, you should get an easy ""A"". If you don't try, shame on you because she is a phenomenal teacher. I wish every teacher I had was as great as she is.

The final exam was very easy; it was originally made up of all essay questions, but we asked to have half multiple choice and half essay questions; she agreed! If you're a senior, take this class!

Her tests are very easy, as long as you know the slides then you are good. She does take attendance, so go to class but it's an enjoyable class. If you need anything, she is very happy to meet you outside of class. So helpful with anything :)",04/14/2011,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
