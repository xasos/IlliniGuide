There were way too many topics on the syllabus, so by the last week he was covering a chapter per lecture, and not really explaining anything.    My midterm was graded poorly, and the final did not reflect course material.  Overall poor course organization.",12/12/2006,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
