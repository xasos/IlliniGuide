Everything is straightforward, a hard class to fail. Open minded, would take her again in a heartbeat. Incredibly smart woman.

The lectures are most of the time very interesting. Make sure you attend the lectures - the attendance isn't very harsh, but if you attend all lectures, you are sure to get an A. TA-Steven Doran very nice.",01/22/2010,1,1.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The midterm and final were difficult so you really have to put the effort. As far as TAs, make sure you have Matt Crain, the BEST TA ever, willing to help you in anyway possible.
