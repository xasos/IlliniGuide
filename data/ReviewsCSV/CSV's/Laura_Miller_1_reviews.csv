N/A,good,poor,good,0,15615806,0,,good,5,CMN260,Laura is the nicest teacher. She knows the material very well. She comes to class well-prepared and lets us out early fairly often. Attendance isn't mandatory but you should go because you need the notes for the exam. I actually posted up a lot of my CMN 260 notes on GradeGuru.com. It's a free website so just sign up and look me up (ESKIM5).,04/06/2009,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
