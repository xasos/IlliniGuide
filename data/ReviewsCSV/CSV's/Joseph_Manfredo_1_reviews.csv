Wish he were teaching in the bands. I bet they would play 80 times better if he were there.

Unfortunately, I feel that this causes a lot of brown-nosing and odd competitiveness in his classroom.

N/A,good,good,average,0,12253238,0,,average,4,MUSIC344,Dr. Manfredo is very demanding of his students because he's extremely connected to the music world and it reflects back on him but this aspect sometimes overshadows his ability to be fair.  He sure packs a punch when he works against you.  Stay on good terms with his friends otherwise you will hurt.,09/27/2006,5,5.0,,2,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
