That said, he is kindly, aloof academic who clearly knows his stuff but can't convey it well. Very willing to help and explain. He doesn't write the tests and the class isn't too hard overall.",10/28/2007,3,3.0,,2,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,13206704,0,,good,4,ECON102,He knows his stuff. Willing to answer any question given by a student. He follows the book almost perfectly. Attending lectures is helpful but not required. He is great with his students. Has some issues during lectures. He says uhm.. a lot and sometimes struggles get his point across. Quizzes are not that hard and he curves generously. Median=B,05/24/2007,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He didn't seem to go anywhere with his lectures and was terrible at explaining topics and demonstrating examples. I would never recommend him as a prof.,05/11/2007,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

If you go to class and actually listen to what he has to say and you pay attention, you will realize that he is a very good teacher and makes things clear.  He is very repetitive and will answer any questions.  Also, if you don't do your own homework, you are screwed. So go to class and do your hw and you will be fine",04/25/2007,3,3.0,,5,Meh,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
