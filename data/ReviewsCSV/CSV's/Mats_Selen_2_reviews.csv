N/A,good,average,good,1,20210723,0,,good,5,PHYS211,"Mats clearly loves what he does: teach physics.  He is dedicated to making sure you know his material, but you have to make the effort to seek his assistance when things get hard.  The class is taught by him and the SmartPhysics program.  The textbook (which he took part in writing) is pretty helpful, but just stick with SmartPhysics. Mats is great",05/06/2012,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
