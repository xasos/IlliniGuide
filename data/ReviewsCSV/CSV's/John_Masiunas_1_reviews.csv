I respect this prof a lot, HORT 105 has taught me so much about veggies.The labs made me get off my behind and do something with my hands other than taking notes! The TAs are also great, you can't go wrong with any of them.",12/16/2012,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO DO THE UNIQUE VEGETABLE CONTEST! All I did was pick a veggie from a farmers market in Chicago and chose a veggie that seemed unique. But dont forget that this is a VEGETABLE gardening class! Boring!,05/03/2012,2,2.0,,5,Low,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I took this class my senior year as a blowoff course but actually ended up going to lecture all the time and even planting my own veggie garden due to everything I learned in this class.
