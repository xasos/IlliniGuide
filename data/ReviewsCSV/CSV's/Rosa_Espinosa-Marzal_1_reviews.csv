N/A,poor,good,poor,0,24550402,0,,poor,1,CEE300,"If you can avoid taking CEE 300 with Espinosa-Marzal, please do. Horrible lectures due to one of the heaviest accents I've ever heard. Extremely difficult content. Tests are extremely hard, but lets you retake them, which bumped grades as much as 50%. Homework due everyday, but attendance isn't taken. Easy to just leave after you turn it in. ",04/06/2015,4,4.0,,2,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
