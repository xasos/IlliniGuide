N/A,poor,poor,poor,0,19353413,0,,poor,1,EPSY220,The class is VERY easy but DO NOT take it unless you don't mind writing a ridiculous amount of pointless papers. The way the class is run can be paralleled to a grade school classroom; notes straight off of a projector/transparencies and plenty of busy work. You will NOT learn anything helpful in the class and her voice is beyond irritating.,12/01/2011,1,1.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She treats everyone like they are idiots and have no idea how to read directions. The material is easy but the prof is terrible and the amount of weekly busy work is ridiculous.",11/09/2011,1,1.0,,1,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
