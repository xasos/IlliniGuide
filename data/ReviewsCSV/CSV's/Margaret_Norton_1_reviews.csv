Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,26698082,0,,good,5,HORT105,"Margaret is a great professor, and this class is very easy.  I recommend buying the lab notebook, scanning the pages you need to turn in, and returning the book.  It's like $50, but you only need the worksheets.  Show up to class for the pop quizzes.  Study the slides the night before exams.  Do the extra credit; it's fun.",06/06/2016,1,1.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people
