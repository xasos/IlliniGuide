N/A,good,poor,good,0,21661741,0,,good,5,MACS364,"This was an eight week class completely about Google. Most classes, you are required to read articles and then you discuss them in class. Easy and interesting, except that the class was 3 hours long. Other than the length, the class is great; Fernando is a really caring professor, and the class is pretty easy.",05/02/2013,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I hesitated to take this class just cuz everyone said it was really hard but the class with him was nothing compared to the things i heard.  I really recommend him for any class just cuz he's really helpful and understanding about situations,05/05/2011,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
