Disorganized in lecture, tests are very poorly written, and uses the i-Clickers for points as a way to get students to come to lecture. If I were you seriously invest your time in the text book because much of the material tested is explained much better in the textbook and Newmark will only confuse you.",05/19/2007,4,4.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Every multiple choice question on the exams are a,b,c, then d. is a and b & e. is all of the above. These tests are impossible. The avgs are around the 40's. He reads from the slides, but uses clickers each day so u have to go. Good luck",05/19/2007,5,5.0,,2,It's my life,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

We had a different professor for the first half of the semester, and then when this guy came, it was nothing but downhill from there. He speaks to quickly, and reads off the slides for the most part.  Not good at all...",04/21/2007,5,5.0,,2,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
