N/A,average,average,average,1,24331894,0,,good,3,ECE350,He uses his own lecture notes so there is no need to purchase anything. The material for both 329 and 350 were hard and his teaching method can be intimating and confusing. His exams are just like the homework so remember to review them. Just write down the end-result for his formula derivations and you'll be fine. Its easy to get a B and higher.,01/26/2015,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person

Sorting out what is important and not was difficult. Paired along with a course with a suddenly steep learning curve, this can be overwhelming. But he knows his stuff, SO ASK QUESTIONS!

On a personal level though, I have seen nothing good about him.
