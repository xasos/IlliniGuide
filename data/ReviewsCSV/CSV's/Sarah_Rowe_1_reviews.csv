She is a great person and very passionate about archaeology. I appreciated all the material she gave us and the discussions we had. We also watched movies which is always fun!

The class does require reading, but if you are a fast reader you can do it in a weekend, easy. This was one of my favorite classes last semester. Movies were fun too. I learned a lot, it's a good 100-level.",03/18/2012,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She gave very helpful advice when I was searching for sources, as well! This was NOT a blow off course, but it was highly enjoyable. DO. THE. READINGS. Seriously, it's novel archaeology.

If you are willing to dedicate a fair amount of time to this class then take it just know that it isn't a blow off course. Quizzes were difficult (tested on reading material we never went over in class) so you need to actually do the reading.
