N/A,average,good,average,0,17974819,0,,poor,2,CS241,"Prof. King had some issues teaching 241 this semester. You can tell he's more used to teaching the 400-level students that care about Systems. He overall wasn't very helpful in adapting to problems students had. Never very helpful with MPs. His final was a complete train wreck. 241 is just awful in general, but he didn't help the situation any.",12/17/2010,5,5.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He is also very patient with slower students, something missing in many CS professors. Exams are fair and based off his lectures.
