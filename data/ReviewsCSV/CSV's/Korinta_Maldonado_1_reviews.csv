Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,25933643,1,,poor,1,AIS285,Kora was the most unorganized teacher I've had. She had no curriculum and your grade was basely purely on whether or not she liked you. I would highly recommend switching out of her class if you find yourself in it. The corse seemed fine towards the beginning but went downhill from there.,01/13/2016,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,person,people
Mandatory,poor,good,poor,1,25874301,0,,poor,1,AIS285,"Nice lady, but this class was completely disorganized and very, very confusing. Expect vague, confusingly-worded prompts for essays, a syllabus that changes in significant ways weekly, and little concrete help. We never received credit for much of the work we did during the semester- the bulk of your grade is based off of 4 essays.",01/04/2016,4,4.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,person
