N/A,average,poor,average,0,11856221,0,,average,2,SOC250,Very complicated and confusing subject matter and since he's used to teaching doctorate students not the best at dumbing it down. Class is discussion based so it was pretty fun.  Final paper on topic of your chosing is the only grade.  Very worthwile and he does a good job of making class discussion interesting.
