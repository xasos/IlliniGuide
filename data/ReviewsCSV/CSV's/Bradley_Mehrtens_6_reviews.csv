He did such a good job explaining everything, and was very clear about what he expected out of students. Go to class and study your notes.

One of those unfortunate professors who love listening to their voice, he lectures without caring much to make any sense. I know it is a large class and the university is going through tough times, but I do wish we had an alternative to him for MCB 150. That would perhaps compel him to get his act together.",02/26/2010,5,5.0,,2,It's my life,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
