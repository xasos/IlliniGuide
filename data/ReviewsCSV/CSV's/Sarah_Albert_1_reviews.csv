Not Mandatory,good,average,good,2,25501204,0,,good,5,ANSC250,Professor Albert is awesome and her class is very interesting.  Despite the easiness of the class I never skipped because of how awesome the lectures are.  Sometimes she brings service dogs into class which is very exciting for anyone who loves dogs.,11/30/2015,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,good,poor,good,2,25254407,0,,good,5,250,I loved this class. By far one of the best classes I've taken on campus. The lectures were interesting- she draws on a lot of important issues. She does not assign much homework and she gives extra credit. Her tests are easy!,10/14/2015,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,2,24879795,1,,good,4,ANSC250,Easiest course I have ever taken. All the tests were online and somebody provided a study guide of all the notes (questions are taken directly from them) on StudyRoom so I only went to class once all semester. Reflective posts were easy and informative. I learned a decent amount even though I did barely anything . Got an A without doing the E.C.,05/21/2015,1,1.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,person,people
Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,24485679,0,,good,5,ANSC250,"ANSC 250 is definitely a very easy gen ed. The tests are all online and there's no textbook, they're only based on the lecture notes she provides. You should go to class though because her notes are fill in the blank & you won't be able to get the answers without going. It's the easiest class i've taken at U of I.",03/22/2015,1,1.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,24378523,0,,good,5,ANSC250,"Sarah is awesome.  The lectures are actually really interesting; I genuinely enjoyed them.  She is really nice and there was hardly any work for the class.  There was only one paper, discussion posts, and a few tests.  The paper was super easy-- it was really just a completion grade.  The tests are straight forward.  I would totally take her again!",02/11/2015,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

N/A,good,poor,good,0,21915087,0,,good,5,ANSC250,"If you're looking for an easy and interesting Western gen ed, this is it. While Albert uses iClickers, the questions are all opinion based, so there's no obligation to pay attention during class. As long as you go to class and listen, there's no reason why you shouldn't get an A on all the tests, the essays are practically completion grades.",06/22/2013,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
