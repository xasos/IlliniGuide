N/A,good,poor,good,5,24777499,0,,good,5,CHLH243,He made the class very enjoyable. He clearly knew the material and always let us out early. Exams were very straight forward with the average grades around 90-94% and no final exam.

N/A,good,poor,good,0,15409535,0,,good,5,CHLH263,"Very straightforward class. Attendance and participation were worth 25% total. 3 exams, 25% each. Basically, go to class and go through the study guide and study the slides and you'll be fine. His lectures usually don't go the full time and you take the last exam before finals week.",01/24/2009,1,1.0,,5,Meh,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
