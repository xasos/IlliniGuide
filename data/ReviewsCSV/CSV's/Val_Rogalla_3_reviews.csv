N/A,average,average,average,0,2928963,0,,poor,2,ACE161,Take the class online if at all possible.  She is a very picky teacher and does not let any errors slide.  Her tests are hard in comparison to the assignments and she was very difficult to meet with outside of class.  She did not show up for 2 meetings I had scheduled with her.,12/07/2004,3,3.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The exams were hard in that if you forgot how to do one small thing, it might cause you to not be able to finish the rest of the exam.",12/01/2004,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,2625422,0,,good,4,ACE161,This is a pretty easy class.  Take it online if you can so that you don't have to goto the class as you can pretty much learn it all by yourself.  Exams aren't that tough and the final is just a project that you gradually work on through the semester,11/01/2004,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
