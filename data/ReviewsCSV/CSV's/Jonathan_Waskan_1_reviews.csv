Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,22489835,0,,good,4,PHIL425,"Great guy, and a great professor.  Approachable and genuinely interested in students' concerns (he is the Philosophy undergraduate advisor, after all).  Lecturing can get a bit monotonous at times because he almost always uses PP slides, but discussions and assignments make up for it.",12/10/2013,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,22445738,0,,poor,1,PHIL425,Really boring and really unhelpful. It's more like a Psych class than Philosophy. I'd avoid this class with Waskan because he's also the advisor for Philosophy and therefore you can't complain about him to him and you will absolutely want to.,12/05/2013,4,4.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
