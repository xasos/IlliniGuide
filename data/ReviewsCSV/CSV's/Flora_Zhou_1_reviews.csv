She drags class out the entire 1h 50 min. for no reason, she just reads off of power point slides and can't explain anything unless its on her notes. So much work, 10 cases and 3 individual cases.

Applying the material is one thing, but trying to figure out where in the question the material IS is another thing entirely.

Cannot explain material and answer students' questions, she really just reads off the powerpoint slides and makes unfair tests that are unrelated to lecture or the book.

However, she seems to not understand American values (I.E -- no one does work over spring break and therefore having a huge paper due the MONDAY after spring break is just silly).
