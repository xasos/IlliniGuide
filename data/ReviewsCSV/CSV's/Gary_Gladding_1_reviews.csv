N/A,average,average,average,0,21248573,0,,average,2,PHYS100,"Prof. Gladding is a brilliant professor, but not a very good teacher. You can tell he knows his Physics very well, but he makes it rather difficult to learn if you are not good at physics/have little understanding of basic physics. My tip: practice over and over and over again, and work with others who know better what they are doing & will explain",01/11/2013,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I found everything to be extremely difficult to understand since everything he does is all conceptual. There is no text book so it is extremely hard to study on your own.
