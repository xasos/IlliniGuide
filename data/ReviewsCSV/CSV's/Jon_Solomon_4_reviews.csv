Also the assignments are not that hard and it's easy to get all of them right. Prof.Solomon is very nice. But one of his TAs is a bit too critical.",10/08/2006,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,poor,good,0,11808889,0,,good,5,CLCV115,"This has been my favorite class so far.  It's the one class the entire year that I actually look forward going to.  His lectures are actually very interesting and he is very humorous, and not in a cheesy way like a lot of the professors at the U of I.  I definitely recomment taking this or any other of his courses.",05/02/2006,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He makes his tests easy, he gives hints to answers on pop quizzes, and the material is interesting.  I learned a lot of cool trivia in this class. TAKE THIS CLASS. Jon Solomon is awesome.",04/21/2006,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
