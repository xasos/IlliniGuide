Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,23743861,0,,good,5,ECE205,Very passionate about his classes. Homework and lectures helped to prepare for the tests and the tests were pretty fair. The guy was pretty goofy but he was nice and helpful. I would take another class from him if I had the choice.

He is very approachable and will do anything it takes to get a student to understand difficult material. He quickly responds to questions on Piazza, the class's online forum. 5 stars is too few for this awesome professor!",04/17/2014,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Definitely on the students side, but the course was just restructured and he was working w/2 other profs and he was the new guy, so where he would've given points back, the others didn't let him.  Tests were stupidly hard for the same reason. Super happy guy.

Cares and knows a lot about the subject, and is also aware of the fact that he is teaching an electrical engineering class to non-EEs. Homework isn't bad either.  Cons: Tests were pretty hard and didn't reflect what we did in class well. Also makes people come up to the board during class, which was annoying.",12/04/2012,4,4.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
