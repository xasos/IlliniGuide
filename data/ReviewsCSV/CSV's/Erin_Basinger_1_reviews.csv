N/A,good,poor,good,0,25680003,0,,good,5,CMN336,Erin was by far my favorite T.A. at UIUC. She is hilarious and knows how to make her class worth while. I would recommend taking any class with her as her teaching style makes it enjoyable to learn the material. The way she sets up her class makes knowing what she expects crystal clear. Her rubrics are spot on and grades very fair! Would Recommend!,12/14/2015,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people

What everybody else said is right on. She's great! And she's really funny, which some people don't really get or care about, but it adds to the class a lot!",11/19/2014,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
