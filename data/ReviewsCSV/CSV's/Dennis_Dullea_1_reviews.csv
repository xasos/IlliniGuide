His class isn't the easiest thing in the world, but challenges aren't always a bad thing. It's well worth the while in this case.

Took an intro to fiction class, ended up learning so much more than I expected! Go to class, read your stories, and do the very small amount of homework he assigns. Also go talk to him during office hours! Makes writing the two papers so much easier. ",05/04/2015,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
