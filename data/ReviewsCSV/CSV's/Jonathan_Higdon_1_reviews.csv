N/A,good,good,good,0,15166112,1,,good,4,CHBE421,"His grading scheme is ridiculous.  He only gives A's to the top 25%.  So even if you study really hard and understand the material inside and out, you still might not get an A.  He tries to trick you on the tests too.  Plus when he lectures, he'll start one analogy, then segway into another analogy.  Makes it all very confusing.",12/11/2008,5,5.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
