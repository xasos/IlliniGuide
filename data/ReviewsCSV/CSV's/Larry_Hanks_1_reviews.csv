Not Mandatory,poor,good,average,0,26035043,0,,poor,1,IB401,"not on track with schedule. Labs do not correspond to lecture. Bug collection is now mandatory when it used to be extra credit. No grades posted online. For lab, family names and order down to the spelling! This class is just memorizing. Hanks is a nice guy but not a good speaker.

He has a monotone voice, but puts in jokes and interesting tidbits which make looking at the digestive system of a cockroach exciting. His exams are super super easy.
