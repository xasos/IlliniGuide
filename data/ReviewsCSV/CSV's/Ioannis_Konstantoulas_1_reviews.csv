At the end of the semester, he gave us a formula sheet and that sheet was extremely helpful. He also gave us many advises for our future math classes (such as PDE's). He made comments about my final exam with detailed analysis. How responsible he is!  Will take his class again!",12/23/2014,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

His test was not easy, as well. We can learn much knowledge from him but we really need him to change the grade policy (he says 93-100 is an A and 90-92 is a A-, etc.). The 80+ is an A is just good.",12/08/2014,5,5.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,poor,good,average,1,23764267,4,,poor,1,MATH2250,This guy gives out too much homework. A lot of professors dont understand that students have more than one class a semester and work. The homework is just very long and the labs were ridiculously hard. Gives you labs that you dont understand and you dont really learn much from them. He is nice and can help you if you go talk to him.........,11/07/2014,5,5.0,,3,Low,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,Not sure yet,,people,person
