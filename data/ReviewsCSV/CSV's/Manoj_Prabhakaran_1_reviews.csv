Oftentimes he doesn't explain what should be explained, and (although he can't control it), his voice is very soft and hard to understand. Most students prefer Chandra.

Often he would cover 5 slides in 45 minutes. He doesn't provide review that's helpful for the  tests, making them unfairly hard.  I got a curved B+,  but I do not have a real understanding of the course. I wish I had taken Fleck.",05/14/2015,5,5.0,,2,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,B+,,person,people

His examlets were very difficult both because of content and time constraints. Hard hw. Doesn't curve much, and Fleck's section is apparently way easier. He also doesn't iron his shirts.

Homework occasionally covered topics that weren't every breached in class, and the book for the class never touched the topics either.  Along with this, grading for the examlets was never really clear.  You would often lose points, but not know why.",05/08/2015,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,people,people

Mandatory,average,good,average,2,24650741,0,,average,2,CS173,Material is highly theoretical and often simply does not get the point across. Exams have averages of 50% frequently.
