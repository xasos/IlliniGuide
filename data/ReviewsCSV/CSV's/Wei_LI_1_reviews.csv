Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,1,25832809,0,,poor,1,ACCY303,"Decent at explaining concepts from his slides but that doesn't change the fact that the final boils down to: ""can you memorize these 40 journal entries and 3 procedures?""

Gives two very dull group projects that you present for no reason!!",12/27/2015,5,5.0,,2,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,person
