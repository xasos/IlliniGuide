She pretty much relied on her slides to teach the class, but those didn't really help.  attendance was not mandatory, but she did do some checks so you could get 2pts, here and there.  mini-assignments weren't bad, and you only had to do 6/10 or something like that.  easy class to zone out in; pretty much taught myself.  no papers though!",06/23/2008,3,3.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Easy class if you make an effort to get the help you need. Reading the book alone won't do it.",01/08/2008,4,4.0,,1,Low,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Her lectures don't really help too much, the book is a much better guide. Lots of reading to do though.
