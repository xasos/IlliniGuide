Mandatory,good,average,average,0,25966005,0,,good,4,CHEM233,Take this the semester after 232 so you are familiar with the material beforehand. Miller is nice and explains in detail on the lecture videos. Watch those or else you will be confused. Your lab grade depends all on your TA without rubric. The final and midterm are challenging because there is no partial credit but not worth many points. Good luck!,01/19/2016,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,people,people

Midterm average was a B and the lab practical average was a 93. TAs can b tough graders & no lab rubric which sucks.
