N/A,good,average,good,0,13694702,0,,good,4,MATH242,His lectures were alright and he was helpful during his office hours.  However his TA's were awful.  For some difficult problems the TA's either didn't know how to do them or contradicted each other which made it even more confusing.  But in the end Ross does give a pretty decent curve which helped a lot.,11/24/2007,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

HOWEVER, he does a HUGE curve and for that reason i would recommend him. i'd take another class of his because i know i'd get an A or B",12/25/2005,2,2.0,,3,Low,3,3.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
