Feedback on papers inconsistent and ambiguous (i.e. a few red marks). Unclear standards. Class team taught with three others was mismatched and uneven in requirements, presentation, and feedback, and lacked proper organization.",12/24/2010,3,3.0,,1,It's my life,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
