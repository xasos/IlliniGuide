N/A,good,poor,good,0,12508545,0,,good,5,RHET105,This class was definitely an easy A. You have little to no work and literally half the time he never showed up to class. It was great! He's very likeable and helpful. I'd definitely recommend taking one of his classes.,12/02/2006,1,1.0,,5,Meh,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The easy A may be easy but you have to sit through his lectures let me tell you, this guy can talk.  You will be amazed how long he can talk without stopping.  Just let you mind wonder and the 1 hour and 15 minutes will go by a little bit faster.",12/02/2005,1,1.0,,3,Low,2.5,2.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
