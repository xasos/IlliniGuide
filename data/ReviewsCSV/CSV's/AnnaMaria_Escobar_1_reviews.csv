The topic is difficult but she doesn't make it any easier. She gives an iclicker quiz at least once a week, and she quizzes us on info we learned weeks before. This is by far the hardest Spanish class I've ever taken. Wouldn't recommend it.",12/07/2011,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She always seems to want to rush on to the next concept when nobody understands what she just taught.

Her PowerPoints are literally the most boring things ever and she does nothing to make the class interesting.
