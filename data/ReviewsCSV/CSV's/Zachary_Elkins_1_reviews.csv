N/A,good,average,good,0,14019171,0,,good,5,PS241,Good class; I-clickers make it fairly interactive.  Elkins is a fine lecturer especially considering that the politics of developing nations isn't too exciting of a topic to most people.  Most of the movies were entertaining.  My only gripe is that too much weight was given to the geography quizzes.,01/18/2008,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
