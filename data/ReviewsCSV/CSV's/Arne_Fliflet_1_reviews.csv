Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,1,25973124,0,,poor,1,ECE210,Worst engineering professor I've encountered. Doesn't seem like he's confident enough about the material he's teaching. As an old professor he's nice enough when treating students; but in terms of teaching he lacks basic clarity and organization in his presentation. Be prepared to teach yourself if you have to take his section.,01/20/2016,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person

All he did was read his poorly written notes, in such a quiet volume that you have to sit in the first 2 rows to hear him.. Even after the class asked him to write on the board instead, he ignored our request. I honestly don't know how he got a job here and I hope he never teaches another class.",12/25/2015,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,D-,,people,person
