I went out of my way to make sure I was in her sections.  While she isn't an easy teacher you do learn a lot.",08/12/2008,4,4.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,11492076,0,,poor,2,LAT104,I am in LAT 104 and I agree that she DOES give a tremendous amount of homework. Here's an example of what our homework was for tonight: we have 62 practice problems and we have to scan a poem 17 lines long. The amount she gives wouldn't be that bad if the class met every other day but it is too much for a class that meets 4 days a week!,02/16/2006,5,5.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She doesn't give an unreasonale amount of homework (maybe 30-45 min. a night, not bad for an introductory language), and she's not all that hard a grader.

Example: There are 15 very long passages that we covered and we had to study all of them, but only part of 2 or 3 of them were actually on the test!! We asked her to narrow down what we should study, but she refused!!",12/24/2005,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,3,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

When she speaks, it all seems to run together. She also gives excessive amounts of homework, making it very difficult to learn the actual material along with finishing the daily homework.
