The TA was inadequate and taught us different material than what was required on the test. This resulted in perfect homework and quiz scores, but low exam grades. The exam questions are vague and no credit is awarded even if it is clear you know the material. Do not take this class.",01/07/2015,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B-,,people,people

Weekly homework assignments take a ton of time, weekly quizzes are pretty difficult depending on your TA, and lectures cover very irrelevant material and move very quickly.
