Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24787932,1,,good,4,PS358,"This class was easy for me because I had a good background in statistics; slightly more challenging for anyone else. Course expectations are reasonable, and I think she helped me learn a lot and sparked my interest in citizen politics. She has a big accent, but she clearly understands English very, very well; she just speaks it very differently!",05/09/2015,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,person,people

N/A,poor,average,poor,2,18045233,0,,poor,1,PS241,Terrible- She spoke only to one side of the room and with her accent and lack of microphone it made it impossible to understand/hear lectures. The TA's were the saviors of the class. The tests were absurd because they focused on details/examples specifically from class and the readings.
