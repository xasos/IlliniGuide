The Prof. was interesting and helpful, and the content was just what you would imagine with a course titled Survey of Theatre Production. Prepare for some long lecturesdays and nights with interesting workshops. Prof. doesn't always respond the fastest to e-mail.",05/06/2015,2,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
