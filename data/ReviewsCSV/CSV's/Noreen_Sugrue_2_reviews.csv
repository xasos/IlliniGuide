N/A,good,average,average,0,14375102,0,,average,4,SOC162,Go to class for large amounts of extra credit given randomly for easy/stupid in class assignments. She is strict so play the game. You can get by without reading but it may make it easy. Tests are open note/book IF YOU WANT = say something during lecture and she will have the class vote. She did it for us on the midterm and final. EZ class overall.,04/30/2008,2,2.0,,2,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
