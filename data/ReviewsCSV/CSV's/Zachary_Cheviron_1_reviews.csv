Doesn't respond to e-mails, and is unhelpful in class. Instead of answering short answer questions logically, just use  buzzwords and you'll be fine.",05/26/2015,5,5.0,,1,It's my life,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B+,,people,people

Exam free response questions are tough but if you do the lecture review questions you should be okay, even so you could lose points for not using a single specific word in your response. Study hard for these exams! ",05/13/2015,4,4.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Quiz and exams are fair but you have to work hard and go to lecture to get an ok grade. There are some amazing guest lectures. ,02/27/2015,3,3.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

He mixed in super interesting side notes that were current event relevant and every slide was concise and clear. I absolutely LOVED him. When Dr.Fuller took over it was like night and day. The lecture actually cheered when he had to come back for the last two days of class. LOVE him.,07/30/2013,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
