If you don't study, you'll probably fail; but, if you do study thoroughly, and do the readings, you can get an A easily.  Very fair. Learned a LOT.  Only teacher I have ever had who knows how to use powerpoint well- makes notetaking easy.  Highly recommend if you really want to learn.",10/22/2007,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
