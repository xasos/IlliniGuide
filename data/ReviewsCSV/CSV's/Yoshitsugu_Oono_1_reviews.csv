N/A,average,average,average,0,23618971,0,,good,3,PHYS427,"Yoshi 's course is hugely improved. He still uses his own manuscript rather than a published textbook, but he is constantly rewriting it for clarity.  Pros:  Text is clear and sufficient with sample problems and solutions Take-home exams Very helpful; answers emails quickly Cons: Lectures are poor Notation is occasionally inconsistent",09/29/2014,3,3.0,,4,Low,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,poor,good,poor,0,14290049,0,,poor,1,PHYSQUAN,"This guy did not use any book.  He used his own manuscript which was incomprehensible.  He did not care about students, and basically said as much during evaluation time.  He expects grad students, but is teaching to undergrads you have never had experience with the material before.
