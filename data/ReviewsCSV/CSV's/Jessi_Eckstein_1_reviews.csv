'til after the 5th time.Class is 50 min. long, so of course she cares if you walk in almost 1/4 of the way through her lecture. She makes things easy to get and anyone who's not lazy or a moron can easily pass. Jessie ROCKS!",11/03/2007,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Hard grader, but guidelines are really clear up front so you know why you got the grade you did. Take her if you actually want to learn something.",02/09/2007,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
