Mandatory,good,poor,good,1,24739793,0,,good,5,SPAN142,"Don't know why he has some bad reviews. He's actually a decent professor. The class is truly relevant for your future field(s) of work. The only midterm was easy and I am sure the final (non-cumulative) will be the same (haven't taken it yet). Online HW is too long, but its VERY easy and you can still miss a few.
