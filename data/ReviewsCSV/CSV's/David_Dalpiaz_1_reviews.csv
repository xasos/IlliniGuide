Lectures were really long also, and my notes were unorganized. I had no idea what I was doing most of the time, but exams were pretty easy.

He helps you out as much as you want since not many go to his office the day or two after homework is due.  Tests are similar.

The margin of error out of 400 was not much at all, but  even so, you learn even if lecture would end up being a snooze.   Very kind person, funny lecturer.  Textbook not needed.
