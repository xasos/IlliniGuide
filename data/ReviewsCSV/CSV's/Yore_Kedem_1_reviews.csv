Even a year after the course, we still went out to Manolo's for a pizza slice.  His opinions on Israel (both history and politics) have shaped my own.

He really wants everyone to pass the class and realizes how hard hebrew is for a lot of native English speakers. It's necessary to go to class because it's a language class, of course. He seems to really care about his students.",11/06/2010,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,13571882,0,,good,4,HEBR201,"Likes teaching the language, but also likes to go at his own pace; which can both fast and slow at the same time. Willing to field questions, but often doesn't like to explain things he considers 'unnecessary'. Most of the time, though, he will end up telling a story to explain why he doesn't want to explain, and then explain anyway. Good professor",10/29/2007,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
