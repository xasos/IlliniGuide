Our final was online and we had two attempts on our online final... Lectures sucked, but overall was super easy. would recommend for matrix theory.",03/30/2016,1,1.0,,1,N/A,1,1.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people

U always feel desperate before exam because he would post a lot of unknown stuff that would be in the exam. His lecture is confusing,and he wastes a lot of time waiting for u and doing extra useless work.

N/A,poor,good,poor,0,17287675,0,,poor,1,MATH441,He is the worst professor I've ever had. He never explains examples and jumps all over the place in terms of material. Our class actually had to have review sessions with the math department before the final because nobody learned anything. Grading is completely arbitrary and unfair.

N/A,poor,good,poor,0,16981763,0,,poor,1,MATH285,He tries to teach the class using real world examples without actually teaching the steps and how to use differential equations first.
