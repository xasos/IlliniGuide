Mandatory,average,poor,average,0,26412622,0,,average,2,RHET105,"I believe she is also really kind and nice person and tries to be as helpful as she possibly can. The problem is that she talks too much about her personal life and as a student, I didn't wanted to know too much about her father, or stuff like that. But she is good! I heard that she was tough grader, but she isn't. She is generous.",04/29/2016,1,1.0,,4,N/A,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

I swear 2 of her assignments were practically identical which only wasted a lot of my time. Annoying that she only gives A's for &quot;truly exceptional writing&quot;--whatever that means.

She'll keep you the entire time, even if she hasn't prepared enough material to warrant an extra half hour.  She self-promotes and soap boxes to the point of requiring us to watch a documentary on wal-mart and reading articles published about her.",12/17/2007,4,4.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She takes attendence, gives you 6 missed classes before your grade is lowered and every tardy counts as 1/2 an absence.
