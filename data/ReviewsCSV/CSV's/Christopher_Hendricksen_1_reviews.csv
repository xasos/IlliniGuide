Why&#63; He graded 1 essay out of the 7 or so he made us right, but it turns out the 1st essay wasn't even for a grade. We never got our final grades and I'm assuming he arbitrarily assigned grades to everyone. Extremely boring, put me to sleep everytime I attended class.",07/13/2011,1,1.0,,1,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

BUT he never graded ANY assignments until the semester was over, so your grade is a total surprise. Very frustrating, I couldn't believe the laziness. I still pulled off an A- but this class was not worth my time.",05/22/2011,2,2.0,,3,Low,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
