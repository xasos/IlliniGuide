This section was all about Drugs, Crime, and Alcohol, and I'll admit that I learned SO MUCH about how messed up our drug policies are here, and I was taught to think critically about why/how these policies are the way they are and how to change them.",03/07/2016,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
