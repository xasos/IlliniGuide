N/A,good,poor,good,0,20255400,0,,good,5,RST150,Mr. Nick is extremely helpful. Easiest class I've taken so far in college. For RST 150 you don't need to read the book he tells you exactly what you need to know on the lecture slides. He doesn't post them online so you should team up with someone in the class or I guess he would probably just give them to you.
