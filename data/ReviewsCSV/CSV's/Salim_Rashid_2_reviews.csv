Furthermore, the way he teaches econ 302 is very different from the way it is taught by the other professors(and there are alot of them). He is an extremely intelligent man, who I think expects too much from his students. Hard to understand also.",05/12/2006,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
