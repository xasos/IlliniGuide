While he has a cold demeanor and is no nonesense, he has immense amounts of time for students with a good interest and a knack for the field. A true educator who spentmuch time on class, with andouts, writeups, papers and  never so lazy as to rely on textbook alone.

With that said though, he can be dull and at times you will be annoyed by the abstract econ. However, I think there really is value in what he intro's you too-- hard core old school econ. Not sure if I would recommend it, but it's an experience. Must go to class, tests are open note.",04/05/2010,3,3.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

There is no textbook, just handouts that are labeled &quot;ECON 303 - Fall 93&quot;, and notes which were nearly impossible to copy down.
