He should stick to research and give up on the teaching dream.",02/08/2014,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,B,,people,people
Mandatory,average,good,average,0,22558271,0,,average,2,CEE360,"As has been said before, his teaching skills are not up to par with what is needed for this course. Although he may be a nice person, that doesn't get you a 4.0.  The homework in his class is graded VERY harshly, so expect 4-6 hours of work per assignment and a low HW average. This class made me back out of a Structural Primary.",12/15/2013,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,C,,people,people

I would highly recommend people wait until this guy has more teaching experience.  He is extremely disorganized and very difficult to follow.  He is very nice and I can tell he wants to help, so I think he'll improve over time.",09/26/2013,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
