The NAP is a pain, especially since the website can shut down & Roach still penalized those students. She tries to make this a &quot;college&quot; course where you have more freedom, but that isn't true.

I had to speak with a TA, who was nice enough to hear my case and regraded the assignment correctly. However, Roach refused to update the grade on Compass, defeating the purpose of the review.
