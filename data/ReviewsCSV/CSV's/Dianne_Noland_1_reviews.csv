In lab she can be very picky about the designs and picks them apart if they don't match her examples. She starts the grading under 100 to leave room for ""creativity points"" that you hardly ever see. Overall a pretty good class though.",03/07/2013,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

You can tell how passionate she is about flowers! The book is not needed, but unless you have a friend in lecture to copy notes for you, you should probably go. You get to take home a floral arrangement every week! Highly recommended!",04/05/2012,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
