He also holds review sessions every week the day before the weekly homework is due, which is also helpful. The class itself is fairly difficult if you aren't great at proving things, but his grading scale is extremely generous. He also gave us 5 exams and took the top 3.

He expects that you memorize all of the propositions, theorems, definitions, etc, so don't fall behind.  I felt that I learned the most from homework sessions he ran, rather than lectures. In class I wasn't sure which details were most important. Generous grading scale. Great Russian accent!",01/07/2011,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Students in this class already understand LP, because it is mostly grads in CompuSci; beware if ur taking it as UG Math. My advice would be to get to know him and do ur best.
