He was a fair grader and gave a ton of participation points. He was so understanding how much other work we had so for the last project he gave us all full credit.

However, he is a really tough grader who may only give one A to the whole class. Even if you pay lots of effort , show up every class and work hard through all papers, you will probably end up getting a B which is unfair to your input.
