Professor Roseman is very entertaining and informative; he has a way of delivering info that makes it stick.  If you go to lecture, you'll do fine.

He wont return emails about the class, so I emailed a TA who never responded.  People posted on compass about how he didn't curve/round-he just removed the disucssion page from our site.
