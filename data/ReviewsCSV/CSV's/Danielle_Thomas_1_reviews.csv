I thought her and the TA's did a great job helping you understand, and gave reasonable assignments.

Just make sure you stay organized. For 307, the class is a lot more structured. Overall, she's zany, quirky, and gets really excited about things. Sometimes, it's scary how easy-going she is!",04/16/2012,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Best prof I've had at this campus! The quizzes were open note, but still difficult so you learn a lot. She is always very laid back, in a good way!",12/08/2011,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She does not use the text for this class but post notes on compass over what was taught that week. Great class and prof if you like group work and a lot of interaction with other students and the teacher.",10/26/2011,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
