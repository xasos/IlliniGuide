Definitely a tough class, but Brent had really good class sides and example problems that made it easier. He is a very approachable guy and really tries to get the entire class involved.

He does an amazing job making sure everyone is up to speed with the material and will take his time to make sure you understand it.  He gets everyone involved but not in a way that makes students feel pressured.  Accy 302 is a tough class, but Brent makes it better.
