Not a bad professor but I cannot learn much in his class. Grading in computer project is harsh. Average professor, don't expect too much from him and be ready to work hard.",05/01/2013,4,4.0,,3,Low,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I was worried that he would be hard to understand, but he has honestly been my favorite professor thus far at UIUC. NPRE 247 is rather difficult, CS 101 will NOT, and I repeat, NOT help you when it comes to the computer projects.  Other than that, he grades fairly and is just an awesome guy in general.",04/15/2012,3,3.0,,5,Low,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
