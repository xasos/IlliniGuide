She is very nice and knows what shes teaching, but know that you are taking an intro to hospital management class. If you are not interested in the topic, it is probably not worth it.",02/10/2008,1,1.0,,4,Meh,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,poor,good,0,13266186,0,,good,5,CHLH250,this was a pretty interesting class. prof. Farner did a really good job of explaining the materials and gives out random points for going to class. tests are fairly easy because you're told whats gonna be tested. only problem was the room didnt have air conditioning so it was pretty easy to fall asleep,06/14/2007,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,13215505,0,,good,5,CHLH0304,"This is such an easy class. Farner is such a great professor and she's very caring. The class is very easy however, you do have to attend lecture because she gives random attendance points. Her exams are alittle tricky but if you study and read all the lecture notes you'll do extremely well. I though the class was an easy A",05/26/2007,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
