Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,26696072,0,,good,5,MATH415,"I didn't know it was possible for someone to love Linear Algebra so much. He nerds out and it makes lectures that much more fun. However,  I found this course to be beyond difficult, the opposite of what I had heard. I was in four other technical engineering courses and this was by far the hardest. Exams were VERY conceptual and tricky.",06/05/2016,5,5.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,B,,people,people

However, make sure to do the homework and never put it off, and you will be in good shape for an A in the class. ",05/26/2015,1,1.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24717675,1,,good,5,MATH415,"He is super-friendly, very approachable, and humble. He goes through the lecture very slowly and tries to relate it the students. His lectures are amazing! He has so much enthusiasm and makes tough concepts approachable and fun. He clearly has passion for teaching and I feel he cares about the students.

N/A,average,good,average,0,23903927,0,,average,3,MATH348,"Prof. Malkiewich is  new at UIUC, but  he is THE professor to take if you are planning to go to  grad school, especially if your interest is in AlgebraitcTopology! The class itself is not easy, so he offers additional office hours when he feels students need it. No extra credit. Good curve. Handsome. Conclusion: you will work hard but will enjoy!
