N/A,good,average,good,0,21109065,0,,good,5,IB270,"Very endearing. Sure he might not always have his stuff together but he's a busy guy. Articulate, clearly passionate about the subject material, fair grader, and wants his students to succeed. Provides ample extra credit, both in the class and on the exams. A kind, quirky soul who always made me smile, I'll miss him.",12/18/2012,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,19337891,0,,poor,1,IB270,"This professor is completely incompetent. Does not know how to speak to a group of 20 students and cannot put thoughts into words. Never comes prepared to lab and returns all items MONTHS late. Be prepared to do poorly on exams and quizzes because if you don't have his EXACT answer, you'll fail. When faced with this professor, RUN THE OTHER WAY!",11/30/2011,4,4.0,,1,It's my life,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
