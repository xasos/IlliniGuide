Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,23548775,0,,good,4,PHIL203,"As everyone else said: this man is brilliant. He uses every class to display his love for philosophy, and he is fantastic at explaining abstract concepts from the readings. However, do not take the prior warnings about his grading lightly - supplement this course with an easier GenEd to balance out your GPA. I'd still highly recommend this class.",08/22/2014,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A-,,people,people

During lectures he manages to translate abstruse philosophical writing into plain English without oversimplification. He also has a sense of humor.
