She never made it clear what she expected of the class and created a very uncomfortable, negative atmosphere, and then reprimanded us for her teaching inadequacies.

She did not post lecture notes online, but they weren't very helpful (full of choppy sentences and unclear points.) She often lectured too fast to write notes either. I suggest bringing a laptop.
