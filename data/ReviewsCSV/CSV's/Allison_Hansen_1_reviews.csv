If you like genetics, studying human genesgenetics and diseases, and using computer applications you'll really like this class. Don't let the bioinformatics part freak you out, this is a really cool class!",05/09/2015,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

She tries to make things interesting by using audience participation and stuff but the lectures are monotonous. You can do well in this class without going to lecture because the powerpoints are online. But she's a smart teacher who is willing to help.,12/18/2014,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
