N/A,average,average,average,0,12667053,0,,good,3,CHEM104,Nice teacher but not all that clear. Instead of having power points he writes his notes by hand on the board which really reduced the amount of information you can learn in class. But go to lecture because his test questions are derived directly from lecture. The 1st test is hard just to scare you and the rest are easier- final was very easy!,12/21/2006,2,2.0,,4,It's my life,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Go to his office hours! It really helped me understand better plus he is really fun to talk to about other stuff not related to chem. I think he will get better the more he teaches.
