N/A,good,average,good,0,16908136,0,,good,5,CHEM102P,I had taken Prof. Ramesh's Chem102P class in spring 2004. She was an excellent teacher who covered the syllabus very well. She made it a point to reach out to students like me who were interested in Chemistry and explained the concepts VERY clearly. I've completed my PhD in Chemistry from an Ivy League University.
