We had i-Clicker questions everyday, so attendance was mandatory, but all the material we learned in class was in the book. PSYC 100 is a lot of material, but I felt like it was presented in an easy manner.",05/08/2013,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Psych 100 is not an easy class, but if you attend all the classes, read the textbook, and study for the midterm and final, you should be ok. There is a curve in the class, but it isn't very much, so studying is necessary. If you try, you should do fine!",06/09/2011,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
