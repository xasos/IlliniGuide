N/A,good,average,good,0,19729309,0,,good,5,ACE240,"Probably one of the best professors I have had. This class is a must, it goes over important financial information that is relevant in anyones life. I am very glad he challenged us because now looking back I am glad I learned this information. It was a hard class, but one I did not mind putting in the extra effort for. Also, he is very helpful.",01/15/2012,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,average,good,average,0,16384693,0,,poor,2,ACE240,"This class was a failed attempt at being organized. The answer keys were often incorrect which lead to diffuculty doing assignments and incorrect grading. I felt my TA knew more than my professor, and while he was helpful, he couldn't give you the proper help you needed because so many students needed help.
