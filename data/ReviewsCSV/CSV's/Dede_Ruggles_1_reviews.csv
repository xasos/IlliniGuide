She loves her subject, and explains everything perfectly. She's got lots of enthusiasm. The papers and tests are graded pretty tough since she wants everyone to think deeply about architecture. Overall great class, highly recommended.",04/10/2013,4,4.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,15381591,0,,good,5,LA222,Prof Ruggles is a strict but very talented professor. I think she grades a little tough for the class level but she wants to challenge her students to do their best & really learn from her class. I found her lectures very interesting & it's obvious that she knows a lot & that she's passionate about what she studies. She can be a little humorous too,01/16/2009,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
