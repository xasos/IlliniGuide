There are weekly reading quizzes, but there are no exams. The semester-long group project is time-consuming but the most rewarding one I have completed in college. Brittany is also willing to give you career advice, so take advantage of that.",04/09/2016,3,3.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people

N/A,poor,good,poor,1,24201393,1,,poor,1,ADV284,Worst class I've taken in my life. 200 level class made into like 400 level. Each point you lose is actually loosing 1 percent of your grade. Very scatter brained and you never know what was expected of you. Group projects are very very time consuming and difficult. Rubrics are very unclear. Thank god I'm done with this class!!,12/29/2014,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,person,person
