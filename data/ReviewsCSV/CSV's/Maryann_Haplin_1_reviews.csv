N/A,good,poor,good,0,12823875,0,,good,5,CHLH274,"I disagree with the last commenter. Maryann was great, it was the prof she worked for that sucked (Karen rosenblatt).  I agree with the grading being hard, but when I went to see Maryann and she told me that she had to grade homeworks based on the prof's answers. so it wasn't her fault. And her review sessions were great, they really helped me.",01/27/2007,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,12304468,0,,average,2,CHLH274,She sucks as a TA!!!! Her review sessions are pointless and don't help at all for the tests so go ahead and skip them. Her grading is the absolute WORST!!!!! Sometimes she'll take off for not explaining things even though u weren't supposed to or if u do then she'll take off for that too so ur screwed!
