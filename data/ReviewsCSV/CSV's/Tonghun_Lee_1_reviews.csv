Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,26696055,0,,good,4,ME300,"Tonghun is different than most teachers. He lectures in his own free form style and doesn't teach out the of the book (you'll need to read it anyway). He repeats himself and goes on tangents a lot but lectures are interesting. The course has two very easy quizzes, difficult hw, and a final worth 45%. The final is brutal but he curves it generously.",06/05/2016,3,3.0,,4,N/A,4,4.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people
Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25143341,0,,good,4,ME300,Tonghun really is the best professor I know. His ME300 is the only class I won't fall asleep in for a whole semester up to this point. I even made a advisor change request to make him my advisor this semester. His personal charisma reflects clearly in his interesting and energetic lectures.

N/A,good,good,good,0,24546403,0,,good,4,ME300,"Tonghun is an interesting teacher, in that he doesn't teach right out of a book. His method is pretty much discussing thermodynamic concepts, helping you understand the theory - but not really helping you solve problems. For that, you need to crack open the textbook and do his weekly, non-graded homework's. Other than that, he's funny and smart.

Judging from comments by people who took this class in the past years (Lee has only been teaching it 2 semesters), it's always been a bad time. Class lacks an overall organization, you're never really sure what you're supposed to be learning.  I skipped class a bunch and crammed all the hw before the exams.

In class he is a little hard to understand at the beginning, but you learn his technique quickly.  He has somewhat difficult HW and midterms, but don't let that fool you.
