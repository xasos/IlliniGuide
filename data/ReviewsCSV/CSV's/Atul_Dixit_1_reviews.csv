N/A,average,good,average,0,20400667,0,,average,2,MATH234,"Extremely stressful. The work done in class was all example problems in the book. The curving is the only good thing about the class. We'd go over easy stuff in class, but the exams would have extremely difficult problems. I'd suggest buying the homework solutions manual because it taught me way more than he did.",06/11/2012,5,5.0,,4,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,average,0,20350526,0,,good,4,MATH234,If you've previously taken a calc class this class is relatively easy. Curved 10% on every test and then curved class as a whole. The final was extremely hard but curving the class definitely made up for that.,05/26/2012,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,average,good,average,0,20205035,0,,average,3,MATH234,I had him for Business Calc...  It seemed like he was just rushing through the course trying to fit information in. DON'T take this class with him if you haven't taken calc before!! the class was unfair for people who haven't taken calc before because the people who have taken it brought up the curve.,05/05/2012,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
