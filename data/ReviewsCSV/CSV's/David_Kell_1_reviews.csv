Not Mandatory,average,average,average,0,26590943,0,online,average,3,CHEM232,"While CHEM 232 is poorly structured at this university, Kell does not help the situation. On the occasions I e-mailed him he was rude and unprofessional. He claims he is busy, yet does no research, does not teach other classes, and has few office hours. Take advantage of SI sessions to pass. Exams are fair because he pulls questions from Mastering.",05/16/2016,3,3.0,,3,N/A,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,C+,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,26368889,0,online,poor,1,CHEM232,He was absolutely terrible. The class is taught using 6 year old videos made by a professor who is no longer in the Chemistry department. He literally doesn't teach anything. He is also very rude during his office hours. He makes the smartest kids feel dumb.,04/25/2016,4,4.0,,1,N/A,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

He rambles and doesn't address the question and I learned more from the TA's, who aren't great. They teach the majority of the class. Lectures are old youtube videos, which don't always cover the homework. This class is a mess. I still learned a lot, but the class isn't GPA-friendly.",04/11/2016,4,4.0,,2,N/A,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,C,,people,people

For a course that is online, a lot of students are coming in for personal help. He spends more time talking than explaining and it's infuriating. He's not good at writing exams as they often have mistakes in them and just don't test you in the right way.",03/14/2016,1,1.0,,1,It's my life,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people
