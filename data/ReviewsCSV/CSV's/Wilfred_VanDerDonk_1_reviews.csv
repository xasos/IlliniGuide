He always sat down with me to do organic chem whenever I needed help. Not gonna lie the material was hard because it is organic chemistry but this professor made it enjoyable. Also, didnt know he was an HMMI professor. Very smart man and one of the tops in his field!",12/18/2010,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,12161315,0,,good,4,CHEM232,"He speaks quietly, but what he says is very clear and well thought out. He is really welcoming in his office hours and just a kick ass professor. He had his PhD by the time he was about 19. He's a genius. Orgo isn't as bad as people say it is. Just look for patterns between mechanisms. A lot of them are similar if you just sit down and compare them",08/15/2006,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
