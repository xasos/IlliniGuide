Mandatory,good,average,good,0,23529239,0,,good,5,MACS373,"Prof. Blake was an absolute joy to have as a professor. The class was on the second half of French and Comparative Cinema, and the list of films was incredibly curated. I enjoyed almost every film screened in class, and the PPT presentation she gave following the film gave new insight. The assignments were manageable and interesting.

She is vague about grading and projects, but I found her enjoyable. Her style of teaching isn't for everyone, but if you have any interest in the subject matter, her classes are great.",10/05/2012,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She quoted wikipedia and Sparknotes gratuitously and spoke in a slow, inoculating tone. She is awful and hope that you never have to take a class with her.

She flat out said to just study EVERYTHING for the exams with no study guide or anything, although paying attention to recurring themes in lecture hint at the exam contents. I didn't like that she was so vague in that way.",01/16/2009,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

The lectures have so much discussion of the history and so little discussion about important aspects of the works we read.  She mentions something in lecture one time and it appears on the final.
