Not Mandatory,average,average,good,0,24254561,0,,good,3,RST316,She's very funny and knows how to keep your attention in class. If you have a question about a paper grade (there are 5 papers)  go into her office hours to ask her about it. All of my papers were graded by our TA so when I asked for her input she actually raised my grade from what he put.
