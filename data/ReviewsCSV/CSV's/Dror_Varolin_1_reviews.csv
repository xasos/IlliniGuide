I'd say he's the best professor I've had yet and he actually kept me interested in the material, which is hard to do.

My raw average at the end of the semester was about 48.5 percent, and I still got a C for my letter grade. His tests are extremely hard, but I definitely learned a lot in the class.

N/A,poor,good,poor,0,3065436,0,,poor,1,MATH242,Dror spent more time trying to be young and cool than anything else. He is the worst math prof. i've ever had. i think he has a complex with being young and having a ph.d. or something like that. he's very intimidating. his lecture examples are useless and you're on your own for learning everything.,12/18/2004,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
