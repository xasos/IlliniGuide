N/A,good,average,good,0,17241462,0,,good,5,STAT420,"Textbook is useless but only because Alex is the best professor I've had on campus. He really cares about the students and has an amazing sense of humor. He gets mad if the class doesn't participate, but if you do, he'll love you.  Also, homework is hard, but it's only to prepare you and his tests aren't horrible. No curve at all, but class is fair",05/20/2010,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
