N/A,average,good,poor,0,19843327,0,,poor,2,PHYS101,"while this is a 101 class it is NOT easy!! The topics were rushed and work and variables were not explained. You were expected to have background knowledge in physics even though it is an introductory course. Professor was not very helpful either, and the tests were heavily weighted compared to the rest of the work.",02/21/2012,5,5.0,,1,Low,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Stay on top of the material! I wouldn't have minded less demonstrations& more time to discuss problem solving. He's a bright professor & I think this made it harder for him to teach at 101 level to non-majors.",01/08/2012,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,19538596,0,,average,3,PHYS101,He was the lecturer for my physics course. The course was bad  because they crammed as many topics as they could into 1 semester. Especially towards the end I learned nothing from lecture because he spent the whole time doing demonstrations that We didn't actually go over concepts. He tried to go over what students struggled with but failed mostly.,12/16/2011,5,5.0,,3,Meh,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
