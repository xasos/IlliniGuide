N/A,average,average,average,1,19012880,0,,average,3,PHIL120,"Professor Neely is bald with a big white beard.  He looks like the true philosopher that he is.  Or a wizard.  Either way, he has a way of explaining philosophical concepts so they actually make sense.  Highly recommended, especially since he is likely close to 100 years old and won't be teaching forever.",09/21/2011,3,3.0,,3,It's my life,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,14012829,0,,poor,1,PHIL105,I would not take this professor. He is completely strange and I never had any idea what he was talking about. You have to be pretty ODD to like philosophy...and thats all i have to say about that!,01/17/2008,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,10699787,0,,good,5,PHIL206,"Neely is the man, very knowledgeable and an engaging lecturer. Worth it just to see his stereotypical philosopher appearance (long white beard) and to hear the various anecdotes from his youth.
 The only weakness is that it's effectively a straight-up lecture, very little participation. Take this now as he will not be teaching much longer.",11/04/2005,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
