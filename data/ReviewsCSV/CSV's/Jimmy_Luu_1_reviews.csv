People who couldn't handle it probably didn't have it in them to continue in a harsh and competitive design world anyhow. If you aren't gonna make the extra effort, you'll hate him. If you do, you'll love him. He is definitely honest in reviews.. if you present crappy work, he'll call you out on it.",05/06/2010,5,5.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He was a great teacher and I am glad I am having him again because in order to succeed in the real world, I'm going to need to have had teachers who give you a real world experience.",01/19/2010,5,5.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He may be at times harsh and snappy but push that aside, you KNOW the guy has a lot to offer. All of his critiques are incredibly valuable & intelligent. Don't get too emotional w/ his criticism, you won't go anywhere.",11/10/2009,5,5.0,,4,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He is completely unreasonable with his expectations (600 page and 50 page process books, explained 4 weeks before due) and is terrible at managing a class (had us watch High Fidelity, so we lost a week that wasn't necessary to lose). He hardly gives constructive comments- they're usually ridiculous or rude.",04/13/2008,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
