N/A,good,average,good,0,15837373,0,,good,5,PS351,He's outstanding in every way.  Crystal clear powerpoint presentations make for easy note taking.  He's very funny and even more personable.  Clear that he hasn't been hiding in academia long enough to develop that off-putting sense of omniscience.  Must attend class and do the majority of the readings in order to get an A.
