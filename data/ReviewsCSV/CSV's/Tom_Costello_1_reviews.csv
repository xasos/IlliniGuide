N/A,good,poor,good,1,24760762,0,,good,5,CMN101,Take Cmn 101 with this man. He's a funny guy with a lot of stories and at the end of the day cares more about you improving than grades (if you've improved you'll get an A basically). Doesn't use the book. Teaches how he wants because he's a rebel. Can tell he honestly cares about the students.
