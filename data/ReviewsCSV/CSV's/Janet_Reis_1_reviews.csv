Self-interested and focuses on having grad students proceed through a ""rite of passage"" rather than any objectivity on their quality of work.

Professor is very straight forward and you do not need the textbook all the answers to her tests are in the notes and lectures.

Notes online will help get you an A on the tests even if you don't go to class, which you should because she makes it interesting. She words the questions on tests so you know the answer. Final took me 15 minutes. Only had to get a 30/70 on it for an A. Can't recommend her enough.",07/01/2008,1,1.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
