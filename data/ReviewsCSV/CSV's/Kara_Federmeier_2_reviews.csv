If you ask a question she'll give you some lame theory answer that doesn't help you understand what she tries to teach.  Cognitive Pysch is something I was interested in, but she totally ruined it.",01/31/2008,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

A simple concept can be turned into something where you say to yourself...wth&#63;  And I guess there was a textbook for this class&#63;  Yep useless again from what I heard from my classmates.

The book is worthless, and doesn't explain anything she talks about. She said on the first day she doesn't teach from the book, but the book should be able to be used as a reference.
