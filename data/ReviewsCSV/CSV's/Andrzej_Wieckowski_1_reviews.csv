Don't let him push you away from Chemistry because the department is filled with numerous outstanding profs. Exams like HW, and the curve is ridiculously helpful.",12/01/2011,2,2.0,,1,It's my life,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The class would be very difficult if the curve wasn't so ridiculous. The exams are very similar to the practice exams provided so the hardest part is really just staying awake in class.",03/20/2011,3,3.0,,1,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
