N/A,good,average,good,1,12538328,0,,good,5,ENGL115,"I thought that she was an excellent professor. I had her for a CHP course, which was smaller so I think that we had more time with her than most other classes would have, but I thought that she was great about making herself available to us and explaining things if we needed help. We read a lot of stuff and I just really loved the class.l",12/06/2006,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

Some of the in class readings were completely boring, but she was really helpful in explaining everything. Our one-on-one meetings really helped in rewriting the essays. The portfolio grading was really easy because you got to rewrite your 3 best essays for your final grade -AWESOME-",08/03/2006,2,2.0,,4,Low,3.5,3.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
N/A,average,good,average,1,10443764,0,,poor,2,ENGL200,"I agree with the paper thing. Her topics were ambiguous so even the best attempt wasn't good enough. Her lectures didn't contain much information because she just wanted us to read stuff in class. She focuses a lot on vocabulary and how we should know it but uses weird vague examples on the exams, which only take like 15 minutes.",09/24/2005,4,4.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
