Not Mandatory,average,poor,good,0,23067504,0,,good,3,PHYS470,"Really nice guy. Very accommodating--he will always answer questions in office hours. I've even gone to him during non-office hours and he is willing to answer many questions. He is not that hard to understand, he just has a bit of an accent. Exams were very easy.  You can tell this guy loves sharing knowledge.  Would recommend for 400-level class.",04/21/2014,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

That said, though, he is extremely knowledgeable, gives great lectures, and is extraordinarily helpful with respect to homework. I'd definitely recommend him for anything above the 300 level or so.",12/23/2007,3,3.0,,5,Meh,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

His lectures are a bit dry but if you pay attention you'll learn the physics.

Most people in his class are either sleeping or not there.  He never gets through the entire lecture, and I always walked away from lecture not feeling like I had learned anything.
