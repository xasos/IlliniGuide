Students lead 23 of the lectures and her 13 was terrible at best. If you want to learn something about soils, you'd have a better chance at a playground.

Was disorganized- added a presentation to the syllabus without warning (assumed we knew). Also assumed we knew the page min. for our papers. Teaching style was not effective, the only thing I got out of the class was from the reading assignments. Because of her, I would not recommend this class.",12/19/2010,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
