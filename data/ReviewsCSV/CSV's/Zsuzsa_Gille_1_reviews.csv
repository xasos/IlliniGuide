One thing about her though, is that she is very helpful, she is always open to questions and helping along the way. Her classes reminded me of a highschool class.

I am purposefully taking a class with her this semester I liked her so much in 366, and I am also planning on taking an independent study with her.  She is extremely knowledgeable and understanding. If you have any interest in Eastern Europe or Environmental studies I suggest taking a class with her.",10/12/2012,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
