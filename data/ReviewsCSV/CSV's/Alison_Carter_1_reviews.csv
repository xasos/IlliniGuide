Anyways, just make sure to keep up with the reading and pay attention in lecture and it should be an easy A.",03/30/2016,2,2.0,,4,N/A,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

I'm sure I'd appreciate her more if I were aiming to be in the anthropology field and if it were a higher level class.

Not Mandatory,average,good,average,0,25766181,0,,average,2,ANTH101,Not a good 8 am class. The lectures are very long and dry especially at that time of the day. The tests are way too hard for a 100 level class. You really have to like the subject or you won't be motivated to read the book as in depth as you have to.

And the reading quizzes every week are way too detailed and are hard to find in the book. I can't wait for this class to be over. This class is killing my gpa, but it counts for like 3 gen eds, which is great.",12/08/2015,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,D,,people,people
Mandatory,average,good,average,0,25362061,0,,average,3,ANTH101,Was told this was an easy class however not with this professor. As said before attendance is mandatory which sucks because it's an 8am. Weekly quizzes that are quite tough and requires you to read the text. Overall it's an interesting class but you have to work for your grade and isn't a blow off class.,11/07/2015,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
