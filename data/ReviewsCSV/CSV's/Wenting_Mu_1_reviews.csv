Not Mandatory,average,average,average,1,24261974,0,,good,3,100,"An average teacher-she talks very slow but is clear when speaking. Lectures aren't really necessary to pass, can be boring and very long. However, she is a really nice person and can be funny. The topics, overall are dry but sometimes she shows videos which can be interesting. As long as you study, this class should be an easy.
