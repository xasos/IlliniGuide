N/A,good,good,good,0,17142807,0,,good,4,PHYS213,Excellent lecturer. He's very nerdy and enthusiastic about physics. Can be spotted swing dancing and ice skating outside of class.

He goes way too fast, he flashes his little science experiments, which btw don't do a thing for helping you do well on the difficult exams, and in general goes over your head.
