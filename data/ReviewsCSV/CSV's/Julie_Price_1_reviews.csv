She is hilarious, dark, a spunky hardass, and more compassionate than any prof I've met. She creates a community vibe in class where people get serious about their writing while still having a lot of fun. She makes you work, but why else should you be at University? Highly recommended.",03/26/2016,4,4.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

You will write many poems, but it's up to you to revise as she doesn't (or didn't in this class) require a portfolio or grade revisions. Strongest rapport I've probably ever felt in a class because she is able to tie everyone together well.
