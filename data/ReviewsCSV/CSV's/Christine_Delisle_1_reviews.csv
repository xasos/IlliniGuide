Her tests are also really hard, though they are curved. In the end she gives grades to who she likes.

Not only did she switch our class mid semester from Native American Studies to just Guam Islander because she's from Guam, but we only had one test and it was almost impossible. Everyone in my class got lower than a C. The readings are pretty interesting, but she seems unprepared most of the time.",08/26/2014,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

Also, you definitely have to do ALL the readings because she doesn't use powerpoints or a textbook in class.
