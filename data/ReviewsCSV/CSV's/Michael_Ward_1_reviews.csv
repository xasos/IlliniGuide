N/A,average,average,good,0,24204933,0,,good,3,NRES348,"Friendly guy. Took me a while to get used to his unconventional teaching style (lots of stories, not much focus on theory). The two exams account for like 70% of your grade, and involve both conceptual free response and multiple choice. But there's some extra credit. It isn't always clear what to take out of lecture, but I learned a lot overall.",12/30/2014,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,average,good,average,0,18855382,0,,poor,2,NRES499,He's a nice enough guy but grades entirely too subjectively.  His lectures are rushed and scattered leaving you unaware of what you should be taking away from all his babble.

He's a wonderful speaker and got me thinking about things I hadn't considered when contemplating management issues.
