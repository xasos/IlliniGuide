N/A,average,average,average,0,21189341,0,,average,3,CHLH101,There are only 350pts in the class & it's very important that you show up for the quizzes whether they are in lecture or discussion. ALWAYS GO TO DISCUSSION! Midterm and assignment was easy; the study guide for the final was very long so make sure you study both study guides; the final went over topics that didn't even seem important to the class.,12/31/2012,2,2.0,,3,Low,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,average,poor,0,17943089,0,,poor,1,CHLH101,Reads right off the slides.  One assignment and everyone did poorly because the rubric was not made until they graded the work (how stupid).I just took the exam and half of the questions were missing and they decided to double up points instead of grade the questions given adding extra points to the questions they forgot to add.,12/14/2010,2,2.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,3,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
