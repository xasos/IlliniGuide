N/A,average,good,average,2,22621343,0,,good,3,ARCH373,"There's a method to his madness. He's craziest of all undergrad studio profs. There are varying opinions about his personality but all agree that the workload is staggering. If you get pass by his quirks, you might just learn a thing or two about arch design and representation. If you put effort, he WILL notice. If not, you make your own decisions.",12/19/2013,5,5.0,,4,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
