N/A,poor,average,average,0,12566521,0,,poor,1,PSYC224,"took this class two years ago and dropped it because prof was boring and course packet with notes was so hard to follow. he knows the material but was not good at teaching it, was boring, and you could hardly hear him since he couldn't figure out how to use the mic. take 224 with federmeier, she puts notes online, is clear, and very nice.",12/11/2006,3,3.0,,3,Low,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,average,average,average,0,3964983,0,,average,3,COGNITIVE,Dulany seems like he knows his stuff throughly but his ability to communicate to a class of undergraduates is limited at best. He seems to find a way to present simple material in the most complex fashion possible. He is better suited to lecture other professors or graduate students. Tests were 80% from his class lectures.,06/05/2005,2,2.0,,3,It's my life,3,3.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
