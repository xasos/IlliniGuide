Her tests can be decently hard, but if you study you'll be fine. She has her students' best interest in mind. Definitely my favorite professor at UIUC so far. Glad I have her again this semester!",01/20/2015,3,3.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,24185079,0,,good,5,GEOL208,"Jackie is really good at explaining geological concepts in details. She's really patient in class to answering students' questions and in her office hours. Her tests can be tricky sometimes but they were fair. Just study up and take a lot of time reviewing the geological time scale. Also, do the extra credit!! They really help to boost your grade.
