Despite being v interested in Women's Studies and the Medieval period, I was bored as well. She is a v harsh grader & she is not responsive or helpful. All in all, I found her v hard to work with. She's an old-school academic who is more interested in her career than in you as a student.",09/10/2014,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,B,,people,people
