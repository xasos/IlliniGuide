N/A,good,average,good,0,25731356,1,,good,5,MCB354,"Morrissey teaches the second half of MCB 354, which ended up being a lot more manageable than the first half. There is a lot of content that he covers, but he doesn't expect you to memorize every slide. He emphasizes the key points, and as long as you get the big picture, you'll do great on the exams. His slides are pretty good too.",12/16/2015,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,person,people
