N/A,good,average,good,0,20183500,0,,good,4,CHLH200,"Very interesting class; class is mandatory but worth it. May not be the easiest A, but as long as u study the slides u should be good. Book isn't necessary; don't get much homework either. Maybe 2 or 3 assignments. Learned a lot. And make sure u study chapter 2 the most; it's the hardest chapter but everything else is easy.

The 1st test is the hardest by far, but after that they get much easier. Ashleigh is a good teacher, and I like the fact that we watch lots of videos in order for us to understand the lessons much easier. She offers a lot of bonus points btw.
