Not Mandatory,average,average,average,3,24299257,0,,poor,2,GEOG110,"It started as a regular course, but he turned it into an online one immediately following the first lecture. It would've been nice if he were competent with moodle. However, my biggest problem is that he's very misleading. He'll tell you that a source is optional reading and won't be on the test, but then he'll have a part of the exam cover it.
