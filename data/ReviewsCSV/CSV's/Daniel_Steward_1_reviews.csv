Though his ability to engage the students was fair at best, but he's always tweaking his teaching style so I'm sure soon enough everything will click.    I also appreciated the fact all the readings were available via Moodle.   Hence no need for IUBTISAmazonetc.  :)",02/04/2015,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Sent out an email saying he will ignore questions that can be answered somewhere on the website. Some questions were for clarification so he was just being rude.

The most frustrating thing about this class is that Dan actually assigns very interesting readings, but he does absolutely NOTHING interesting with them. His class has no structure at all.
