I had her for Soc 100 as well, and that was also a very pleasant experience for me. She has also made herself available for me to ask questions on multiple occasions, and she is very flexible.",05/06/2011,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The only reason I showed up was for the extra credit she gave you every once in a while for coming. Easy class, but if you have the option of another professor I would switch because with her you will be teaching yourself.",08/02/2010,2,2.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Go to illini exchange and get a used soc 100 workbook so you don't have to attend lecture.  She will hand you a study guide the week of the test, rest assured.  You only need about 2 days to study for this test.  Pretty easy class, even if you can't understand her.    4 credit hrs of A!",03/16/2010,1,1.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
