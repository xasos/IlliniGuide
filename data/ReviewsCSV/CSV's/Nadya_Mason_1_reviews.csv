Not Mandatory,average,good,average,0,24757667,0,,average,3,PHYS436,"The exams were tough, even when she specifically said that they'd easy. Not that I blame her - it was a tough class. The textbook, Introduction to Electrodynamics by Dave Griffiths, is a godsend.

N/A,good,good,good,0,21627606,0,,good,4,PHYS435,"Professor Mason teaches straight from the book, but that's probably because Griffiths is an amazing textbook.  Her midterms are moderately difficult, but an insufficient amount of time is given to take them.  The final is significantly better and is worth 40% of the grade.
