Not Mandatory,average,average,poor,1,22544724,0,,poor,2,ECE573,"The course is actually quite interesting. However his teaching method is boring and inefficient. The slide is full of definitions and formulas but lack of examples doing homework becomes so hard. No TA, no official homework solutions so you don't know if you do it right or wrong. Studying for exams is so stress. The exams is too tricky and hard.",12/13/2013,3,3.0,,1,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

He teaches with slides that his grad students make, his grading policies are completely bogus, and he enjoys embarassing the class over teaching. DO NOT TAKE 398RES.
