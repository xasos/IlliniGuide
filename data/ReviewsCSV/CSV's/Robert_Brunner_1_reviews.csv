N/A,poor,good,average,1,13645896,4,,poor,1,ASTR122,DO NOT TAKE ASTR 122 WITH BRUNNER!!!!! It is very complicated. It involves very complicated equations. You dive into Einstein's theories of relativity and specail relativity about 5 weeks into class. The online homework is abundant and involves a lot of math that is so easy to make simple errors because the numbers are ASTRONOMICAL.
