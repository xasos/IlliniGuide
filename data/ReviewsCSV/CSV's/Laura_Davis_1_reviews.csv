It was hard to sit in her lectures, but she gave small quizzes in class once a week. The class itself was not too hard, just do the study guides she gives for tests and you should be fine.",08/07/2013,2,2.0,,3,Low,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She was extremely spacey and never answered your questions completely. Class discussions were very repetitive. However, she did offer you some insight to cultural anthropology.
