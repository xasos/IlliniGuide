N/A,good,poor,good,0,3964995,0,,good,5,CHEM103LAB,"Charlie is by far the greatest TA ever known to mankind. He is an easy going, amiable guy who knows his chem. He is very approacable and easy to contact out of class. I must have asked him at least 4 questions during each lab and he was always eager to help. I will without doubt call him up in the future for all my chem needs. You rock Charlie.",06/05/2005,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
