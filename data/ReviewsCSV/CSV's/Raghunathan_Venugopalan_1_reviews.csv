N/A,average,good,average,0,13627305,0,,average,3,ACCT2050,Knows his stuff but is very intimidating and uses &quot;cold calls&quot;.  He makes fun of you if you answer a question wrong and gets angry very easily. His exams are much more difficult than his quizzes which are extremely easy.  He doesn't have an overall concern for his students. Don't take this guy.,11/09/2007,5,5.0,,3,Meh,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1257,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
