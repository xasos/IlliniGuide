Not Mandatory,average,average,poor,0,26631667,0,,poor,2,MATH225,"Math 225 with Robles was basically pointless, instead of doing actual examples, he wasted away the 50 minutes trying to type up pre-worked examples into MATHTYPE.  The lectures were boring, and I don't even know why I ended up going to most of them.  On the bright side, I found the class pretty easy, all the exams are easy A's if you study.",05/22/2016,2,2.0,,1,N/A,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,25979636,2,,poor,1,MATH225,I sit up front and can barely hear him. He reads off online notes and does no real time examples. When he does an example he goes so fast you will not be able to follow unless you understand the material. I currently use khan academy to learn which is pathetic since his lectures are practically useless.,01/22/2016,4,4.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,3,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,Not sure yet,,people,people
