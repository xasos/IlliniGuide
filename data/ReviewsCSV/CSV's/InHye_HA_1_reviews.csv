Her teaching style focuses more on the plot of books than anything else and really doesn't seem suited to a college-level course, and doesn't include much of anything on Enlightenment culture. She is, however, a kind person, and willing to help if you ask.",12/27/2014,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,Rather not say,,people,people

She made the class unnecessarily hard. Although we did not have a final exam, we were required to give a final presentation over papers we hadn't completed yet.
