Mandatory,average,good,average,3,25863164,1,,poor,2,RLST110,"This class was taught differently, where each new religion had a new lecturer, but when he was up at the podium, he didn't seem too great. He's super anal about texting in class or using your laptop to take notes, so expect to use a pen and paper. He was really passionate about the subject, just not the best at presenting the information.",01/03/2016,4,4.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,person,people

Not only is he infectiously enthusiastic about his field, but he also goes out of his way to meet with and help students. Essays are graded leniently, and the midterm is easy if you pay attention during lecture.
