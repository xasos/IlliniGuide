N/A,good,good,good,0,24894826,0,,good,4,MCB408,The exams often test very picky details and there are a lot of passage based questions. Wording of multiple choice makes it easy to miss if there's a slightest bit of doubt in your mind. Honestly this is one of the most relevant MCB courses I've taken. Lots of memorization in the first half. But also an emphasis on understanding.,05/24/2015,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,24554710,0,,good,5,MCB408,"Kranz's exams feel like an all immunology version of the MCAT. Passage based questions. Stand alone questions. Emphasis on application. He puts ""More than one answer is true"", ""Both A and B"", ""None of the above"", etc as answer choices to see if you truly understand the material. There is a lot of detailed memorization as well.

The Tests are really hard, but if you study directly off the lecture slides, you can get an A on the 4 lecture exams. Almost all exam material comes directly off lecture slides. Kranz is a nice guy, gives hard tests",08/08/2010,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

While the grading scale is generous, lecture is boring and tedious.  Kranz will start one thought without finishing another.

He's had a bunch of success in his professional career, but he's still as friendly, accessible and willing to help as can be to the undergrads who take his course, which is generally rare with professors that have had his level of success.
