Slides are posted on Compass, so there's really no need to go to lecture much.

Never posted grades on Compass because she said it was &quot;broken&quot;. What was supposed to be a fun, easier class with Turino (who is AWESOME) turned into a nightmarish bore.",12/28/2007,2,2.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
