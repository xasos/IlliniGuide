N/A,good,average,good,0,11672086,0,,good,5,ACCY301,Super awesome guy!  He explains things really well and made class fun.  We always got out about a half hour early.  He is a very no BS kind of guy.  He is also sarcastic and funny.  It was nice that he actually has real world experience to apply.  If you go to office hours he will love you.,04/07/2006,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
