The clarity of instructions is prarmount to achieving the objective goals. There is no organization in his postings. Assignments are not given back before the next assignment is due.

He starts the first day talking about objects and programming concepts that will be hard to understand for a beginner. He wants to help, but can't teach very well.

Don't expect to understand the lectures without a little bit of knowledge from Jason's Notes. Did not learn much from the lectures.

Needs more experience, and it's noticable that he considers his performance and what he can do. There was a general consensus criticism in Mid-term evaluations and he changed what he was doing right away.
