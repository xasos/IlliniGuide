N/A,good,good,good,0,21922672,0,,good,5,IB433,Dr. Frazzetta is clearly passionate about the material he teaches. Lecture slides are a bit wordy but he covers everything in depth and clarifies any questions students have. Always patient and helpful. Tests are difficult but fairly scaled. If you pay attention and attend class regularly you will do fine on exams. Great professor!,06/25/2013,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He is very intelligent, knows what he is talking about, and his lectures will teach you so much about the field of evolution. No text book, just two exams and a presentation on a paper",12/17/2011,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,12091,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The guy is really cool and VERY smart and he treats you more like a scholar than a student, which is kind of neat :P You take one essay test and give a presentation and that's it.",11/08/2011,2,2.0,,5,Low,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,12091,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Tests are tough and tend to be set up a little strangely, but grading is extremely fair (80-100 is an A). Lab difficulty probably depends on TA, but if you get Jim you're good. VERY interesting class!",12/11/2007,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,12091,N/A,,N/A,,person,person
