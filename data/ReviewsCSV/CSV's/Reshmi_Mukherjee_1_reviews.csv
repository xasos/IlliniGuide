Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24692420,0,,good,5,BRITISHLIT,"Reshmi is incredibly intelligent and supportive. She pushes her students to succeed, inside and outside the classroom. She's friendly, funny and incredibly patient. She's also very approachable. I try to take a class from Reshmi every semester, because she's one of the smartest and most engaging professors I've ever had. She makes school fun!",04/28/2015,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Her way of grading is a bit unclear, but if you incorporate some of the analysis that's discussed in class into your writing and organize it and write to the best of your ability, then you will be fine. She is a very smart woman!",04/24/2014,2,2.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people

I know who she is and she complained from day one and missed a good portion of the class and wondered why her grade suffered. I for one had no preconceived notions prior to taking this class and loved every minute. Reshmi bent over backwards to help all of us. Great Professor.

She tries to control the direction of conversation and doesn't seem to see students as educated or active/ employed individuals. Instead she seems to feel that she is bestowing some sort of brand new info on ignorant students.",11/29/2012,2,2.0,,1,It's my life,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
