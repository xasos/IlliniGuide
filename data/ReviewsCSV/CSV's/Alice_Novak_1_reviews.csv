The field of planning is extensive and she successfully touches upon the different aspects of urban planning. Novak provides study guides for each week's content, so if you answer all of the questions on them the quizzes and tests will be easy.

N/A,good,poor,good,0,15192175,0,,good,4,UP101,The class was easy but she was too preachy on Historic Preservation. I didn't feel like I came out knowing much more about urban planning than I did going in. About half the class had to deal with urban history and the other half we had guest lectures and touched on modern urban issues.,12/14/2008,1,1.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
