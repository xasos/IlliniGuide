N/A,average,average,poor,0,17212227,0,,poor,2,SHS120,"This class is a joke. You are forced to attend, but there is no incentive to pay attention. For an 8 week course you need to go to 3-hour lectures which are pointless because tests can easily  be aced from powerpoints. Rispoli is EXTREMELY inflexible and very condescending when you try to talk to him in person. Take Cravens.",05/16/2010,2,2.0,,1,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
