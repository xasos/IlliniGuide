Sometimes went into advanced theory which wasn't really necessary but overall he made the class very interesting and worth taking.  Tests were VERY difficult but he curved the class so it worked out.  2 group projects as a heads up which take many, many hours to do",12/11/2015,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,person,people

Exams based on math skills, so suggest you take mathematical statistics before taking the course. Plus,  I'd recommend prepare another reference book as source. The textbook does not do fine for beginner. ",10/28/2014,5,5.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,Rather not say,,people,people
