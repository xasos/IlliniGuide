Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,24774844,0,,poor,1,EALC125,Worst professor ever. He never gets to the point and never instructs student in the right way. His class assignments are out of nowhere but mandatory and tough. You just feel like he is talking about his own wonderful life and left the students tons of papers and final which is 3 short essays (wtf?) without any clue. Never ever take his class. ,05/08/2015,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,people,people
