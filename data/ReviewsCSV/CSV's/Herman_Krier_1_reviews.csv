N/A,good,average,good,0,15803068,0,,good,5,ME410,I had professor Krier for a Compressible Flow course in 2005 and he taught the course very well.  The course text was by Oosthuizen and he supplemented material with other texts where appropriate.  Always in good humor (in his sense) and willing to help students.  Homework supplemented lectures well and exams were fair.,05/09/2009,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Funny, clear explanations, homework is fairly easy yet still prepares you thoroughly for the course, tests are fair and don't have tricks.
