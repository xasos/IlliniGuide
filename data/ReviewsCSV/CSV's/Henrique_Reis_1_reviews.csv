His exams are rather difficult, but he does grade easily. He is honestly a funny guy, and a good person. Show that you care, attend class, and STUDY THE PROBLEM SOLUTIONS to do well in this course.",05/04/2010,4,4.0,,4,Meh,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,person

This guy is worthless, the GE department should be ashamed to have a guy like him on their payroll!!  He doesnt grade things and assigns random grades at the end of semester.",05/27/2009,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Material is difficult and useless, teaching style is nonexistant: he just writes on the board, never stopping to explain anything. Easy to fall behind.

He never hands back homework and Im not even sure he grades everything right. He grades sort of easy but his tests are hard and you are unsure about the material when you take it.,12/15/2005,3,3.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He threatens to take photos of you with his digital camera if you fall asleep, but I'm pretty sure he doesn't even have one.  Doesn't grade your homework or probably anything.  Very messy and disorganized.  Difficult to understand.",12/04/2004,4,4.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
