All the resources to do well are made available to you - prelectures, homework, lecture slides, but you do have to put a fair amount of work in to do well (if you are not naturally good at physics).

However, for PHYS102 he was okay as an instructor since it wasn't hard to teach myself after he went over the basics in lecture. Crammed for every exam and got an A.

Great teacher--but DO NOT LOSE POINTS on attendance, pre-lectures, checkpoints, or homework, because UIUC is stupid as usual and has a HARDER grading scale than normal for physics.
