Tests were hard but she told you exactly what would be on them so no surprises. Hardest part - way too much vocab. You'd have to know 300 potential words for a test and get asked 10 of them. But I learned more grammar in this class than 4 years of high school. ,06/22/2015,4,4.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

She is undoubtedly brilliant and kind, but she operates her class of SPN3300 in a manner that makes it more difficult that any other teacher at the Spanish department. You have to learn a ton of vocab, while most of the other teachers ignore it or gloss over it. She also grades surprisingly hard on presentations.
