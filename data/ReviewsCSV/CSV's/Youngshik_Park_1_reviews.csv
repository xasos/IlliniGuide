N/A,average,average,good,0,16231884,0,,good,3,CHLH244,"I took this in 07.  He is helpful and VERY nice.  Just ask him questions after class or during office hours.  Yes, it is a bit hard to understand him when he speaks English, but try to be understanding.  English is NOT his first language.  Just think about how your own language skills would be if you had to lecture/speak in a foreign language.",10/11/2009,2,2.0,,5,Meh,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The only reason I got an A in this class is because for the midterm you got 2 sheets of paper, front and back, and could write anything you wanted on them and use them for the exam. You got three sheets for the final.",03/07/2009,2,2.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

His lectures are boring, but you have to go because he gives a short easy quiz at the end of pretty much every lecture.  I learned everything in the discussion sections.  Take STATS 100 with Ellen Fireman instead if you can.  I've heard good things about her.",12/15/2007,3,3.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
