He structures the class so you learn a lot of it by yourself. The exams are T/F and usually one or two problems like the homework. He tests you on mostly everything during the final, but you're allowed three cheat sheets. I'd say most people get A's or B's though.",12/17/2010,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
