N/A,good,average,good,0,25167289,0,,good,5,ENGL325,The class was fun and interesting and I honestly enjoyed it. As long as you do your readings and engage it's hard not to get an A. If you don't like reading academic articles (or just articles in general) the class may not be for you as most nights there were 20-40 pages of reading assigned. ,09/02/2015,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

She provides valuable information from the long articles she forces you to read, yet when you use it in your papers, it is never enough. More over, the presentation she requires you and your group to use are graded harshly although she gives the ""ok"" to do whatever you feel.",05/15/2015,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
