Mandatory,good,average,good,1,22225258,0,,good,4,RHET105,She rocks. Loved her. She took a super boring class and made it interesting and is always looking to accommodate you. She'll help you when you need it and it's really convenient. If you have to take rhet (most of us..) try and get Larabee. I feel like the class I take versus the rhet others take are two complete different classes because of her.,10/28/2013,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

She is clearly passionate about teaching and helping students, and made class enough fun that - though we got 3 excused absences for the semester - I never missed a day.
