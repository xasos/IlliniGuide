Rubric seems fair  but looking at the grade posted, you just have no idea how you lost 30% of the paper grade. Have written many papers before, all As. Got a C in this one, no idea why. Is this a suitable paper for a 100 level class anyway? Don't think so. Exams were okay but be prepared to read",12/16/2012,5,5.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Exams are kind of tough.

Only 2 exams (easy multiple choice) and 3 short papers (~3 pages each).  Readings were unnecessary if you went to class and review sessions.

He is an excellent public speaker, but most of the time you get random professors from the department teaching the different portions of the course.
