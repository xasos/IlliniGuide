N/A,good,average,good,0,14392503,0,,good,5,SPAN452,"She is a PHENOMENAL professor. An amazing person. Super understanding when it comes to a student going through an emergency. She is awesome and very clear. Some of the readings are difficult, though she explains concepts really well. Her exams are based on what she explains in class and she even gives extra credit sometimes. Again awesome person!",05/03/2008,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
