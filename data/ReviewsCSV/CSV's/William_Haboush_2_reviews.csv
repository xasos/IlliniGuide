N/A,poor,good,poor,1,18650263,0,,poor,1,MATH415,By far the worst class I've taken at the university.  He obviously knows the material but teaches almost exclusively by proofs. There will seldom be a numerical example.  Most of the class didn't attend lecture because it was useless.  Midterms were easy but final covered some material we didn't have homework on which I thought was kind of unfair.,05/23/2011,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
