N/A,good,poor,good,0,18039978,0,,good,4,GEOG101,"Jose was just fine at lecturing. He is kind of funny sometimes, but he DOES have a noticeable Puerto Rican accent when he speaks which can be hard for some to understand. Other than that, go to lecture for random pop quizzes, go to discussion, read the book, and do your work; the class becomes EASY if you do this. Jose expects good work. So do it.",12/24/2010,1,1.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Very unfair grading, no matter how much you study for the midterm and final an A is pretty much impossible.  Hard to get in touch with..impossible.

Lecture notes must be memorized, and one must be able to retrace all the stories ( it is not know what's on the exam) in a fair amount of detail.
