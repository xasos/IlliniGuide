Not Mandatory,good,poor,average,0,22665088,1,,good,4,IB105,He's a great professor. The exams are based on the lecture slides.  Lectures are not mandatory but there are iclicker questions.  Discussions are worth 39% of your course grade.  The class is very easy.  There are weekly pre-discussion videos and questions to answer.  There is only  one research project in this course.

Kind and accommodating - I had a small conflict with an exam and he allowed me to take it in his office at a later date, no problem. You will learn so much and be captivated no matter your major.

Ben Clegg can be a bit confusing and can go off on tangents, but he's a sweetheart and SO knowledgable. If you can stick it through the evolution of time, then I would recommend this course.

The class was also a little disorganized and he took over a month to get exam grades back. The discussions were completely pointless and the material was a little difficult for a 100-level class.
