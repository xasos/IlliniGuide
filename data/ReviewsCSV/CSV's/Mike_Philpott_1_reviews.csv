N/A,average,poor,average,0,24342045,0,,good,3,ME170,"ME 170 is extremely easy.  There are in class assignments that are guaranteed 100% if you are in class, no tests, and the rest of the class is a lab.  In the lab you follow the book step by step.  The last four or so weeks of the semester are a group design project.  Lectures are somewhat dry but you have to tough it out for the assignment credit.",01/28/2015,1,1.0,,4,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
