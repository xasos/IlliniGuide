And although the class name is &quot;urban transportation planning,&quot; we focused more on crunching numbers than anything else, rendering the class useless for learning much of anything useful about transportation planning - NOT recommended.",05/28/2008,4,4.0,,1,It's my life,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
