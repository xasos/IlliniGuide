He'll scare the crap out of you first semester, but that's because 203 is really a weed out class to get out the losers that can't handle the work.  If you need help, he is the one to go to; he's the smartest person around, seriously!",11/01/2006,4,4.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I think it would be better if Tom taught us to respect lab and dangerous chemicals as opposed to using scare tactics, but it helps to know all this to appreciate him",01/15/2006,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
