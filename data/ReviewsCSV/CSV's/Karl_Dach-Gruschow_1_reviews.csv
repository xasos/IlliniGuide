N/A,average,good,average,0,16071500,0,,good,3,PSYC333,I can see how some people might find Karl to be a pretentious jerk but if you got to know him outside of section and spoke to him one on one he was actually a pretty cool guy who was very willing to help. He specifically told me that he only helped people who came to him and would not go out of his way so make sure to schedule appointments with him,07/28/2009,4,4.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,11853511,0,,good,4,SOCIALPSYCHOLO,Karl is a really nice guy and doesn't care if you come to class.  His sections are a bit boring.  His quizzes are harder than other TAs.  But he lets you justify your answers and get credit for the &quot;wrong&quot; answers if you can explain your choice.   nice guy.,05/09/2006,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
