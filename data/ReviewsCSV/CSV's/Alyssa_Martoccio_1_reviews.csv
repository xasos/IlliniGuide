N/A,good,poor,good,0,19721918,0,,good,5,SPAN141,I thought she was very flexible and easy going. Make sure you go to class...and besides if you have any questions with the material that is the time to ask.

She does a lot of in-class group stuff where u have convos with other ppl, some useful, some not. No oral exam (woo hoo). N participation is part of the grade so go to class...on time.
