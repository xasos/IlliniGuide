Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24962689,0,,good,5,MCB354,"He's totally changed his teaching style from when he taught a few years ago. Now he is super straightforward about what he wants you to know. He tells you exactly what is important to study. GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS!!! He is happy to guide your studies if you take the time to go to them. Gives review slides before exam, containing everything to know.",06/13/2015,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B+,,people,people

He lets you know what's more important for the exams, but if mechanisms aren't your thing, be prepared to cry. I tried learning them all, but I just kept getting them mixed up.

Review sessions were EXTREMELY helpful, I would suggest going to them. He doesn't teach this class every semester, he mentioned teaching every 2 years.

If you email him or go to office hours he will respond in a very clear and respectful manner to students. With that being said, he is not very good at teaching. His tests were extremely indepth and lecture was boring. Get ready to memorize everything ever mentioned in lectutue.",01/14/2009,5,5.0,,3,Meh,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
