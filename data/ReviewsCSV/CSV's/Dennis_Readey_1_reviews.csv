After 2 weeks of his class I have already seen that he expects his students to know material he has not taught (and not in prereqs) and his exams are difficult. Online ppt slides are usefull, especially because I can't stay away during his lectures.",09/15/2011,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Even though in class he tends to ramble and his tests are surprisingly difficult, but if you go in for his office hour, he will explain things to you in detail. Also, they slides are a big help on his exams.",12/19/2010,4,4.0,,4,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
