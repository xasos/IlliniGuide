Not Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,26563655,0,,good,5,EALC130,"Dr. Packard is an awesome lecturer. He is very passionate about the Chinese language. The attendance is not mandatory, but you have to come to class to take the notes because he would not post the lecture slides on the compass. Easy class! Just memorize the web quiz questions for the exams (midterm and final exam only!).",05/13/2016,1,1.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people

Mandatory,good,average,average,3,23052095,0,,good,4,CHIN204,"Dr. Packard has a good sense of humor, but the best thing about him is that he won't let any ""half-assed"" Chinese slip by unnoticed.  He spends five minutes trying to get a student to pronounce one word right - and he won't move on until you say it perfectly.  Even the T.A., who is from China, won't correct wrong tones.  Dr. P is da boss.",04/16/2014,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people
