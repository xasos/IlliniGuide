Not Mandatory,average,good,average,0,22808783,0,,poor,2,MSE304,I have to say if it is a simple course just for material on the book. But he makes it much more difficult. His lecture is ok. But his homework neither strongly related to the lecture or book nor clear enough to understand what the question means. I dont think his homework is helpful at all.,01/31/2014,4,4.0,,2,Meh,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
