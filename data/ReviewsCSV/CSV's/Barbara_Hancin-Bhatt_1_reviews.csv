N/A,average,poor,average,0,17509943,0,,poor,2,GLBL100,"she was awful. Her knowledge seemed to only be at surface level on any issue and she is horribly boring and uninspired. Mandatory for GS majors so no real way around her, unfortunately. Just smile, nod, and volunteer. You  an expect about as much from her as she expects from you: not much.",08/13/2010,1,1.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

None of the TA's seemed to understand what she wanted, thus it made it difficult for students to understand what was expected of us. I can't believe she's a program director because she's so disorganized, confusing, and gives a LOT of busy work..",07/08/2010,2,2.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Hancin-Bhatt only teaches for the first week or two of class; the rest is guest lecturers. She is boring, attending is unnecessary, but overall not too boring. Depends on the guests. You do learn some things though. Not bad, not good. No text, readings unnecessary",12/15/2008,1,1.0,,2,It's my life,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
