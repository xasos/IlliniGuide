Make sure you read so you can participate. If you don't, you won't get anything out of the class and a bad grade too. If you read and participate, you'll enjoy it.

I went to almost every class, which I never do, just to see him and hear him lecture. And when I missed class I seriously went through withdrawal. I've seen him around campus, but talking to him makes me nervous, so I'm just going to take another class again!

A lot of reading, to be honest. you need to read in order to participant the class, otherwise, it's bored, you will have no ideas what others are talking about. but, toward the end of semester, it's kind of relax and laidback. 2 papers, no exam! some pop quizes to make sure everyone read those novels.",05/21/2007,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
