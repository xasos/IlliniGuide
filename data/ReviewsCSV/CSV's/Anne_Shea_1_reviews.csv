She's one of the nicest people ever, very understanding/caring, but to the point that she's almost too nice and easy, especially for upper-division. You will only learn based off how much you AND your classmates care to learn",05/08/2009,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,3067,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
