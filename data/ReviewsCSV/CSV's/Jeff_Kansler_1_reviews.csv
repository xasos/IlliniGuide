He takes FOREVER to write things during lecture and there is always a lot of down time waiting for him to perfectly write the notes. It got annoying.

N/A,good,good,good,0,21833049,0,,good,4,ARCH352,Kansler is a great person but his class was lousy. NOTHING was returned in a timely matter and we lost 20 minuets off our final time because he didn't prepare the test in advance. On the test many mistakes were made. The final project was a complete disaster and no one knew what to do or if they were doing it correctly.

N/A,good,average,good,0,21679796,0,,good,5,ARCH352,I hope he sticks around because he class was my favorite this semester. He will take the time and make sure everything is clear to every student if he has to. It can be annoying sometimes when most of the class gets the topic but i appreciate that he cares about the whole class. The grading on hw can get tough depending on your TA.,05/05/2013,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,21220733,0,,good,5,ARCH251,The two courses that I took with Jeff Kansler were vitally important as a beginning understanding of building structures which were then built on in the following year with more difficult information.

Tests don't have enough time and he is monotone he cares but obviously does not want to be here. If you seek him out one on one he is MUCH more helpful.

It isn't too difficult to do well if you attend, finish homework on time, and make an effort with the projects and exams. And the best part is he is certainly easy on the eyes. ;)",04/27/2009,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
