N/A,poor,good,poor,0,19165430,0,,poor,1,CHEM360,This was the worst class I have ever taken in my whole life. Worse than Calc 2 & 3 and Orgo 1 & 2. You just read lectures and he doesn't teach you in class and gives you worksheets that he expects you to be able to do without any clarification as to what you supposedly learned. He's sarcastic when you ask questions as if you're dumb for asking,11/04/2011,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,poor,0,19130330,0,,poor,2,CHEM360,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! I took this to finish my chemistry minor and I have never taken a worse class at this university. The material is interesting but the teaching (if you could even call it that...) is horrendous. You are expected to remember EVERYTHING from general chemistry and this class is solely based upon you teaching yourself.,10/30/2011,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
