Reading the book will help you understand things more but dont expect to find any questions related to the book on exams. He is a good professor though but having to teach a class of like 600 students its not gonna work out very well.,03/10/2011,4,4.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
