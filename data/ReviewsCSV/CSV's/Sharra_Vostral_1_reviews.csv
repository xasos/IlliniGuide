She related our readings to current debates on women's issues. Not a lot of work- short/reasonable readings for class. 2 group presentations/essay which were fun and really hands on with material. And another 2 pg essay-easy! Take!",10/27/2012,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Literally all we did was talk about our opinions, and since this is an intro. course, these people had no idea what the hell they were talking about, therefore I learned NOTHING.
