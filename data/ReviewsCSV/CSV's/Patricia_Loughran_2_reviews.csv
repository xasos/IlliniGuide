Her tests are not all that difficult if you actually take the time to study for them. What nobody here has mentioned yet is that if you failed the midterm, you had the chance to drop the grade completely in place of the grade you got on the final exam. Her lectures are very bland though.",11/02/2006,3,3.0,,3,Meh,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
N/A,good,poor,good,1,12098866,0,,good,5,ENGLISH255,I think she may have read some of the comments previously posted on the website and completely changed when I had her.  We lucked out sort of and had a small class so it was easier to pay attention and learn.  You HAD to go to class and read.  She held test reviews and brought donuts & pizza.  3 or 4 small tests and gives study guides!  Pretty easy,07/23/2006,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

 Bad: the grading was strict, the tests were long and difficult, the lectures were extremely boring, and she was very rude. She told the class that she intentionally made the midterm difficult in order to punish those who did not come to lecture and those who slept through it.. &#63;! not very fair.",03/25/2006,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

When OVER HALF the class received D's or F's on the midterm exam, her response was that we should &quot;get serious&quot;. Also employs a nigh-exclusively autobiographical interpretation for nearly every text we read.
