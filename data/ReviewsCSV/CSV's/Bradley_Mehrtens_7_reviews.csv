He talks fast, though, so be prepared to write frantically.  In my opinion, lectures are essential as anything he says in class (a lot of which is not written on the powerpoints) could be on the tests.",01/26/2009,4,4.0,,4,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,14938140,0,,good,5,MCB150,AMAZING!  He is definately one of my favorite lecturers ever.  True he can seem like a bit of a jerk sometimes but that is only cuz he wants you to think about the material.  And if you think about it for a second you realized he really did give you the right answer...just not always directly.  I definately recomend him 100%.

Make sure not to slack on pre/post lectures; I recommend doing them right after class.  Take lots of notes and try not to miss any lectures.
