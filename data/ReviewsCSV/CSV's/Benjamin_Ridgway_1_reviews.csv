Every class is talking about the stories you read, and we have read ALOT. Make sure you get all your books! Do the reading and talk a bit in class and you'll easily get a good grade. I wish I could take more classes with him but they don't fit in my major. Ridgway is a good teacher! :)",05/01/2014,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people
