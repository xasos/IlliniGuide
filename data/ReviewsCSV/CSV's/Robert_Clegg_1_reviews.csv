N/A,average,good,poor,0,18641230,1,,poor,2,PHYS214,"Avoid Clegg at all costs. He just seems to ramble on in lecture. Absolutely no class interaction whatsoever. The man teaches quantum and thermal physics but still can't figure out how to work Powerpoint for his lectures. I learned nothing from this guy. So either pay attention and ask questions in discussion, or take Kwiat's lecture.",05/20/2011,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

Painfully boring. He starts off a lot of phrases with &quot;Clearly&quot; and &quot;It's easy to see...&quot; which is just annoying",11/13/2008,4,4.0,,1,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
