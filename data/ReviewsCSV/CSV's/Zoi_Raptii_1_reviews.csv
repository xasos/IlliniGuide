She has a great way of teaching new material, but expects that you remember a lot from previous classes (even the obscure stuff that professors sometimes forget!)

N/A,good,poor,good,0,19572304,0,,good,5,MATH442,Basically follow the text book so that attendance is not necessary if you can read the book yourself. Grader is pretty harsh... Exams are easy since she gives review sheets. We can bring a cheat sheet to the final and the 2nd midterm. Not many proofs but many calculations.,12/19/2011,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Before each exam, she gives out a review sheet that tells you what to look over. Very fair grader. Some of material can get difficult. Only part I didn't like was that sometimes, the exams tested your algebra manipulation rather than PDEs understand.",12/15/2011,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
