Mandatory,average,good,good,0,26007038,0,,good,3,MATH286,"Dyachenko is new to teaching. He did a good job answering questions though he needs to work on time management. Also the tests were simply too long for 50 mins. I would HIGHLY recommend asking him questions outside of class. I went to his office hours (often empty) and got lots of help. He is patient, helpful, and sure to improve in the future.",01/28/2016,4,4.0,,5,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people
Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25808899,0,,good,5,MATH286,"Sergey gives very interesting and detailed lectures with plenty of examples. At times the examples use more time and effort than they should, but overall one gets out what one puts in. Tests are hard, but he makes up for that by adding curves and/or bonus questions. My only complaint was the harsh homework grading, but that's the TA's fault.",12/23/2015,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

As my friend said, you're better off just reading the book rather than listening to Dyachenko's confusing lectures.",12/19/2015,5,5.0,,3,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,D,,people,people

Gives impossible questions on tests sometimes as a result of negligence. But makes up for it in the end. Class is laidback and relaxed, he jokes around often, even during tests. As for most math classes, lectures are useless, just read the book.",12/17/2015,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,person,people

Brutal exams with material unlike the lectures. Provides very few examples - most of his lectures consisted of proofs.
