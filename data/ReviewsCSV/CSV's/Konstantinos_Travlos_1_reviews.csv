Mandatory,average,average,average,0,22696331,0,,poor,2,POLLS1101,"Was an overall easy class. He follows the textbook and quizzes and tests are super easy. A little haphazard, though. Doesnt keep accurate records of attendance and loses quizzes. I was present every class but received a 0 for the portion of the grade, which resulted in my receiving a B. Dont take him if you can help it.",01/04/2014,2,2.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,B+,,people,people
Mandatory,average,poor,average,1,22555499,0,,average,3,POLS1101,Took gov with him at GA Southern. The class is easy if you just use the textbook to study for midterm and final. He curves tremendously. Attendance is taken so bring your laptop or other work to keep yourself busy because the lecture is hard to follow. He is a nice guy and he wants you to do well. Got an A with minimal effort.,12/14/2013,1,1.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,person
N/A,poor,good,average,0,22543553,0,,poor,1,POLS1101,Now at GA Southern. Lectures are boring and pointless but you must go as attendence and participation are vital to your final grade. The book will be your best friend in learning/understanding the information. Offers extra credit. Nice guy and wants to help students but take he is a LAST RESORT prrofessor.,12/13/2013,4,4.0,,3,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,22541598,0,,poor,1,POLS,"DO NOT take this teacher! He is at Georgia Southern Univ now. I was in a large lecture for Am Gov, and the midterm+final are 75% of your grade, and the other 15% is attendance and ""watch participation"". You must know what week your ""watch"" is and talk or else you'll get a 0! So that automatically drops your grade one letter! HORRIBLE!!!",12/13/2013,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Went to class everyday in a big lecture hall and was continuously marked absent, why even take roll in a class of 300? He lost my quizzes. And he only had the Midterm and the Final as the main grades, other than a measly 10% for quizzes and participation...",11/14/2013,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,C,,people,people

Did everything he asked for on the paper and took a lot of time on it and recieved an F. Which isnt good because paper grades are a large chunk of this class",05/04/2013,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
