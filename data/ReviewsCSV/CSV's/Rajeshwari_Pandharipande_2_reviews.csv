My best advice for the class is to read her textbook which contain the shortened story versions. Much less painful to read.

Only down side is that she always asks &quot;is that point clear&#63;&quot; and someone asked her to repeat what she said. And she told the student to ask her after class.

Completing the readings is VERY important; you might be able to get by on just that but the lectures clarify alot. There are slides and films during lectures that you'll be tested on.
