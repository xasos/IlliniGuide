There are quizzes every Thursday which are moderate in difficulty. Online hw's are pretty easy. you can work with anyone you want. Definetly worth taking to fill a gen-ed.",04/07/2006,2,2.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,average,average,0,11278178,0,,good,3,ATMS120,"Prof. Jackman was funny enough (sometimes a bit corny, but bearable) and did often make the topics really interesting. He's a good teacher overall, but he sometimes goes a bit fast while explaining difficult concepts and if you're not quick to catch on to every detail he mentions, you could easily get lost. Don't be afraid to ask lots of questions!",12/30/2005,3,3.0,,4,It's my life,3.5,3.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,11215177,0,,good,5,ATMS120,"This was an easy Gen Ed with a great professor. The curve is amazing, 85 = A-, 71= B-. The material is interesting sometimes - hurricanes and blizzards and stuff, and Jackman makes a lot of it seem more fun than it actually is. Highly reccommended gen ed class, but make sure you get jackman. He's really sarcastic and will keep you laughing in class",12/19/2005,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
