As long as you are are nice and talk to her every once and a while you can sit in the back and never get called on. Plus she grades easy too so just make a good impression and the class is a breeze . plus the in class group activities are kinda fun (better than a boring lecture).,09/26/2011,3,3.0,,5,Low,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
