The tests are not hard if you study the practice exams. Also, the top test grades count for 2/5 of the grade where the lowest only counts for 1/5. The class is also curved.

The grading, however, is very difficult.  Tests are too short (no room for error) and tend to draw from moderately obscure text passages.
