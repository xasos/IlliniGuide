He will point out what you should improve during presentation but I don't think he is taking too much points off it. It's a little hard to pay attention to class but the materials are really useful! And the in class assignments makes sure you are not falling behind.,12/09/2015,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,average,average,average,0,22270056,0,,poor,2,ADV491,"He's a nice guy and his classes aren't too hard. But, his teaching style is horrible. I took two of his classes with completely different topics and they ended up being almost the same class. He is very boring and only uses powerpoints and reading tests. His accent is terrible and he barely understands what he's saying. Avoid him if you can.",11/06/2013,3,3.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
