Her class is boring, but its a 100 level anthropology, so honestly what do you expect unless thats your specific field of interest&#63; She let me take a make up quiz (which counted for a decent amount of my grade) at the last minute. The class is EASYYYY and she makes great study guides.",04/22/2010,2,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

From her monotone voice, to the bland gray backgrounds of her powerpoints to the stupid, useless nature of the material this class is TERRIBLE!
