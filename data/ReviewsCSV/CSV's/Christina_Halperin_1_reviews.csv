N/A,average,average,average,0,15965065,0,,poor,2,ANTH220,"One of the worst lecturers ever. She never seemed to understand what she was talking about, and always acted confused&#63; Was she stoned&#63; I mean seriously, she makes about 10 factual errors per lecture, and if anyone speaks up, she blubbers and sputters and can't clarify because she is perpetually confused. She can't lecture. Easy A though.",06/16/2009,3,3.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She doesn't post any of her notes. She also gives out pop quizes to make sure to be there. Overall, okay class for a gen ed but not very interesting.",11/19/2008,3,3.0,,2,Low,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
