N/A,average,average,poor,0,13564337,2,,poor,2,ENGL255,"Words can't express my distaste for this professor - he told the class was a poor student in school; it has resulted in his being a very poor instructor. He gives lectures of irrelevant information that won't be included on the tests, for which you receive no help or advice on how to prepare. TERRIBLE, cocky, unintelligent instructor.
