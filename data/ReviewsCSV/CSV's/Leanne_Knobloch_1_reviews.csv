I had Kimberly as a TA, she is great as well. Fair grading. the end-of-semester workshop is a little annoying, but still a great class to take. Textbook material takes up 40% of the exams.

N/A,good,average,good,0,20808018,0,,good,5,CMN230,I love this class. Professor is really clear and interesting. However you will despise the textbook but she is forced to use it. Easy grade as long as you do your end of the work. Study what is only on the study guide & you get to make your own grading scale to play towards your strengths (i.e. if your good at writing papers) .. take this class,11/09/2012,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Exams are easy, all multiple choice. She gives you a study guide before, so you know exactly what information to hunt down in the textbook and what to know from lecture notes.
