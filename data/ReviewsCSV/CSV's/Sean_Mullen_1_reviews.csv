He's a very laid back professor, who really wants to see you succeed. going to lecture isn't required but his slides are geared towards the people who come to class, so it would help to go to class because he explains the material in terms we understand more clearly.

Most people are threatened by clarity that is supported by evidence.  Sean is an evidence-based person, and if you are rating him low because your unsupported opinions conflict with his, take a better look at yourself.

All the material is very ambiguous and very similar and he does not do a good job differentiating/explaining the material on the slides. He also has a huge ego, which can be annoying.
