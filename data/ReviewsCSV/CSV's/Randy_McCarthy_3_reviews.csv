The tests are difficult and long still. If you do your homework and go to class you should be fine.",02/10/2009,4,4.0,,3,Meh,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He did not put anything on the exams that weren't expected and told you exactly what would be on the exams. If you go to lecture, do the homework, and go to lecture then you will do well.",12/03/2008,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,good,average,0,15068799,0,,average,4,MATH220,Horrid professor! His exams are really long and not only does he not give you enough time but he also makes the next exams longer. Worst of all you never know what to write on the exam for full credit. Overall awful professor! Avoid at all cost!,11/27/2008,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,average,good,poor,0,12223057,0,,poor,2,MATH406,"MATH 406 was by far one of the worst classes I have ever took. This professor took a course, which everyone thought would be a walk in the park and turned it into a one of the hardest courses I have ever taken. If you think that math 406 with Randy is going to be easy think again. I received my lowest grade from this guy out of all my classes.",09/09/2006,5,5.0,,1,It's my life,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I'd take a math class from him over any other math professor I have had...you have to take what you can get in the math department.",12/17/2004,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
