N/A,poor,good,poor,0,22190553,0,,poor,1,SHS450,"Eaisly the worst professor I have. I am happy that he is gone. I couldn't stay afloat in that class and when I went to talk to him about my grades and my understanding of the course material he said it was all my fault because I didn't understand. No kidding, that why I went and spoke with him. Also he never responded to my emails.",10/18/2013,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He does not respond to emails regarding scheduling to meet, or for coming to office hours (you just have to show up, and hope he is there). He goes extremely fast through lectures, and does not take time to help confused student.  The downfall is that all SHS students need to take this course.",05/04/2013,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

His slides were bare and he speaks so fast that it becomes necessary to record lectures so you can revisit them. I feel like he is probably a nice man, and totally equipped to teach this course but the structure of the class was AWFUL. His demeanor towards his students was appalling.",01/09/2013,3,3.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Good study guides, lectures in a very linear way. In juxtaposition with the SHS300 class we all had to take at the same time, this class was super well organized.

He's super smart, very helpful, intimidating at first but awesome once you get to know him. The tests are reasonable, well written, and the material is cool.
