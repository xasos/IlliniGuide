What's sad is that it easily could've been a great class with such good material, but Kaplan's breakneck pace, complete lack of insight, and thinly veiled contempt for her class made it horrible. The tests were bad. Not hard- hard implies some useful and hard-won knowledge. They were BAD. Dumb.",05/05/2006,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Mid-term was the most bizarrely stupid test I have ever taken. Kaplan seemed a bit snooty and touchy at times in lectures, making them less pleasant than they could have been.",05/09/2005,4,4.0,,1,It's my life,2,2.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,3634073,1,,average,3,CWL242,This class had the most pointless test I've ever taken. The reading was unbelievably heavy. More than my other classes combined. We read entire novels in two days; didn't talk at all about them. The tests were not based at all on these massive readings- they were on minor facts mentioned in lecture.,04/15/2005,4,4.0,,2,It's my life,2.5,2.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
