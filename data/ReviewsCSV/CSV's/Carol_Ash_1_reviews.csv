So if you're an engineer or applied mathematician I would highly recommend taking her. For a very rigorous teaching, however, look elsewhere.

She uses notes that have all the problem answers explained so theres nothing you can't understand,if you do all the probs in the notes you're fine for the tests.

Fortunately I had already learned most of the material in other classes so I did well. Overall I found the class pretty worthless.
