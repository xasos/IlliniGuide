His book problems aren't hard(not too many assigned either), its the non-book problems that take a long time.  Felt like class was a waste, I just read the book.  From my experience, I wouldn't take another class with him.",01/16/2010,3,3.0,,4,Low,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

As long as you pay attention to what he writes down in Lecture, his accent isn't a problem.  His tests are very straight foreword, and he doesn't give a lot of homework each week.

N/A,average,average,good,0,13035491,0,,good,3,MATH385,"hilarious guy... If you can understand the accent he's a pretty good teacher.  Although he does trail off a lot into practically muttering sometimes while teaching.  Other than that the class was reasonable, he knew what he was talking about, and he wanted you to do well in the course rather than worry about grading.",04/19/2007,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
