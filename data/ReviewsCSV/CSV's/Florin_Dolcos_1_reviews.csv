N/A,poor,average,average,0,21622664,0,,poor,1,PSYC496,Confusing class.  The teacher never wrote what questions were right/wrong on the first exam taken.  The last two exams haven't been graded the entire semester so there is no telling what grade you might have as that is what the class is graded on.  He never uploaded grades on compass either.  I have no idea if I'm even passing this class as of now.,04/28/2013,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The class he teaches is so useful to anyone trying to learn about how the brain works, and it is interesting how he produces scientific data to back up what he says. Somehow he manages to make it really funny too. I would recommend the class to any student, grad or undergrad.",08/29/2011,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,18962727,1,,good,5,PSYC496,"Interesting class, funny teacher, and not too hard if you pay attention in lecture. You learn a lot of interesting things that you can use in everyday life that will impress others, but it's not too difficult to learn. I would recommend it to any grad or undergrad student. I took it as an undergrad and really benefited from it. Check it out!",08/29/2011,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

Professor Dolcos somehow finds a way to make the class interesting and he is really funny. The class is easy if you pay attention to what is said in lecture, but you will still be able to impress others with how much you learn. Great class",08/29/2011,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,18779902,0,,good,4,PSYC496,"I thought this class was easy and informative. Only journal articles to read, 3 tests, and a 12pg paper.  For this being a joint grad/undergrad class, it was surprisingly easy if you followed the slides and have an interest in neuroscience.  Dr. Dolcos is important to his field so don't be surprised that he authored many of the readings assigned.",06/30/2011,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
