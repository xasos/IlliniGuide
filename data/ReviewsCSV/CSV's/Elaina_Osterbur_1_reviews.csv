She talks in circles most of the time and is more interested in her son than the class itself. Focus on your final project and you'll get an A.,01/11/2011,1,1.0,,4,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Exams are take home, can be really easy or really hard. No consistency. I would never recommend this class to anyway because her lectures make no sense and are therefore extremely frustrating. In general she's not very kind or understanding.",05/11/2009,2,2.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
