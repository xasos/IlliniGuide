N/A,average,poor,average,0,24055375,0,,average,3,101,She was the TA for a 101 class that I took. The material was super simple but attendance was mandatory and the discussion did not add anything to the material. She has a bit of an accent but not as bad as other TAs I've had. She's very nice. ,12/12/2014,1,1.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
