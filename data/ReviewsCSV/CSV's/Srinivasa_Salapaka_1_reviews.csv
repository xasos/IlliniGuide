N/A,average,good,average,0,14547344,0,,average,2,ME360,Salapaka is an alright professor but what I really didnt like about him was that he was not careful at all about writing lecture notes. There were always mistakes which made the class even harder to understand. He bases his exams on the hw and class examples so going to office hours really helps clear things up. He also keeps candy in his pockets,06/09/2008,4,4.0,,4,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
