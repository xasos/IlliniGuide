The lectures are not limited to course material, even if the programming assignments are the same every semester. The ""textbook"" for this course was written by him, and we had free access to it. On the whole, I would say this was an easy though not a trivial class.",05/05/2015,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

This review was obviously written by the Professor himself to fend off the other reviews stating he does not teach the API, but requires its use for course projects. In fact, he made almost the exact statement during lecture.",12/27/2014,5,5.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,Rather not say,,person,people
Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,22993286,10,,good,5,CS418,John Hart is one of the most laid back professors I have ever seen. Yet despite his simple slides he teaches quiet well. The fact that he did not teach us OpenGL calls is good. The point of cs classes is to teach us what is going on behind the implication and how to think through problems.

You know you can't lecture when only about 25% of the students come to class - and he even made fun of those who don't attend lectures. If you think his slides are sketchy, then wait until you see the regurgitated stuff during the discussion section. OpenGL is not taught, he just relies on his ppt slides to ""teach"".",12/11/2013,2,2.0,,1,It's my life,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

His slides are really terrible, so I don't recommend skipping much, but that shouldn't be a problem since his lectures are usually pretty entertaining.

His lecture slides are by far the worst I've ever seen, lectures are unorganized with no clear focus, and exams are probably repeated from previous semesters. He is lazy and unhelpful. The MP's are in openGL which is not taught",12/02/2012,3,3.0,,1,It's my life,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
