N/A,good,average,good,0,14756840,0,,good,4,KIN140,Relatively easy class if you study notes before exams.  If you are having trouble nice guy and willing to help. Mandatory attendane only because he uses skeleton notes...find a buddy in the class and you're golden!,08/19/2008,2,2.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,poor,good,0,13395216,0,,good,4,KIN140,"The class was very easy.  Attendance is mandatory. There are skeleton notes, you just have to go to class to complete them.  The test questions come DIRECTLY off of the notes, meaning it's the only thing you really have to study.  The discussion/lab section usually only lasts an hour even though the time allotted is 2 hours.  GOOD CLASS",08/09/2007,1,1.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,12224003,0,,good,4,KINES140,Grade comes from 3 exams (2 - 1 hour exams and an hour and a half final exam) worth 25% of the grade each and a discussion section with 5 assigments worth a total of 25%.  Attendance is not required but I highly recommend it. This class is basicly the first in a series of sport psych classes.,09/10/2006,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
