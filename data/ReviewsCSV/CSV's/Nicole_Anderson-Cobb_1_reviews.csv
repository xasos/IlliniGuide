At times, she can be a little unorganized with the syllabus but this doesn't take away from the  class itself. As long as you read the material and are fairly interested in what you are learning,  you should be fine. ",11/18/2015,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people
Mandatory,average,average,good,0,24987883,0,,good,3,PSYC410,She was very unorganized with the syllabus. Didn't explain the grading system clearly at all which did harm for a lot of students. She all of a sudden at the end of the semester said that she is not going to include any EC assignments already done by students in the final grade. She is definitely very passionate about the class though.,06/23/2015,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people
