This is by far the best class I have taken at the U of I. Rios is a good teacher, makes the topics easy to understand, and  he's pretty funny too. If you go to all the lectures and take notes, the exams are really fair. Great class!",04/26/2010,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

This class was easy, interesting and enjoyable. It also moved at a slow pace which made it easy to ACTUALLY learn the information.",04/19/2010,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He rambles, and puts little effort into any of his own tangible references for information. This class is not &quot;hard&quot; however Rios is one of the worst professors I've had to date on campus... beyond frustrating. Ask anyone (aside from above) if they liked class and they'll say NO.",04/15/2010,4,4.0,,1,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I actually enjoyed going to class, and Prof. Rios made it enjoyable. If you go to class, pay attention, take notes, and do all the assigned readings, the class really is fair and fun!
