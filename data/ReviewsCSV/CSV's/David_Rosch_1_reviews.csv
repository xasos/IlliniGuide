Mandatory,good,average,good,0,22829560,0,,good,4,AGED380,"Dave was the BEST professor have had at UIUC.  He genuinely cares about his students and is always willing to meet to give clarification on material.  Dave mixes in great activities into his lectures to show leadership concepts and keep the class engaged.  Lecture can be boring at times. This class takes a lot of effort, but it is very practical.",02/09/2014,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A+,,people,people

Some said course was difficult, however, he offered plenty of extra credit - and I noticed the ones who labeled the course difficult were also the students who claimed they didn't study.  Pay attention in lecture, take notes - he's a very fair grader.  Love taking classes with him.",01/14/2014,2,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A+,,people,people
