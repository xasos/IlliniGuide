N/A,good,poor,good,0,13583408,0,,good,5,CHLH206,Extremely easy class.  I ended up with over 100% for my final grade.  The night before one of the tests I went out and got wasted instead of studying.  I looked over the notes while walking to class and got 100% on the MC test.  Very easy. Definitely recommend.,11/01/2007,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
