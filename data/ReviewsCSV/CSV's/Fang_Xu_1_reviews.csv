Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25371806,0,,good,5,ARCH374,"I think Professor Xu is sharp and efficient in terms of teaching skills, which is so crucial for Junior year in Architecture. Students learn a lot with this type of teacher; He is open as well. You don't have to agree with him on everything to get a good grade",11/09/2015,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Doesn't always understand exactly what question someone is asking.  Loves doing Rhino tutorials... Loves.  Needs to manage his time better for desk crits. You can avoid him forcing you to change your project by tying everything to your concept.,10/11/2014,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,Not sure yet,,people,people

He knows a lot about Rhino so make sure too pick his brain. The only negative is that he doesn't talk too much about architecture theory, which I was hoping he would. Solid professor though, make the most out of his section by asking him questions",01/10/2014,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,B+,,people,person
N/A,poor,average,poor,1,21833003,2,,poor,1,ARCH373,He changes students projects at the last minute and makes horrible decisions. All his design choices are tore apart in review. He docs people for being 1 minute late and again changes your project no matter how much you object. He takes to belittling students who do object. Simply put a horrible professor to be avoided at all costs. Very bad breath,05/27/2013,3,3.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
