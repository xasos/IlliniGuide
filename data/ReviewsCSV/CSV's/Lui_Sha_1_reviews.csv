The course is packed with topics with the assumption that you MUST research about them after class.  Don't miss classes. Read the books.  If you want to be a real engineer, take it and survive it!

He is the worst professor I have ever had (in term of teaching not personality to be fair). He doesn't teach, he just show up, try to be funny, and leave. Concepts are not defined or explained in organized way. This course really sucks.",09/15/2014,4,4.0,,2,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I can't believe the CS department keeps this guy on.
