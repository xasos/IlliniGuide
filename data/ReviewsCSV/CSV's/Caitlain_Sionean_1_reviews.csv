N/A,poor,good,poor,0,13725303,0,,poor,1,CHLH304,Probably the worst teacher at this university. The class isn't interesting but could be taught using a much better approach. She seems to want to have her students do as poorly as possible. Assignments are not clear with no set instructions. TAs and professor oftentimes contradict each other as to what is expected.
