There are no tests but there is a LOT of reading and a LOT of writing but he is a very fair grader and if you do your work and go to discussion you will be fine. Also he is wonderful to look at, and he will help you if you go to his office hours so GO!",04/13/2013,2,2.0,,5,Low,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
