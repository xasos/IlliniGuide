Professor Travis did her best to deliver the information in the most comprehensible way possible, but it felt like she was nervous every time she started talking.

N/A,average,good,average,0,16629713,0,,average,3,PSYCH100,Don't take this class unless you have to. You have to know a TON of material and it is not as interesting as you might think it will be. Exams are MC but are still difficult. There are also quizzes and assignments you have to do outside of class (10 quizzes and 4 assignments I think) that are fairly easy.,12/23/2009,5,5.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,average,average,average,0,16386475,0,,poor,2,PSYC100,She has the most annoying voice EVER. She gets confused a lot and can confuse her students in the process. She's nice but she often runs out of time and skims over important info. READ the book and take the practice exam. If you can't make it to class it's not that big of a deal because her slides are online. Give your iclicker to other people.,11/17/2009,2,2.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Only a couple short out of class assignments, super easy A. Exams contain written and multiple choice, but if you go to class, understand the notes and skim the book, you will do great.
