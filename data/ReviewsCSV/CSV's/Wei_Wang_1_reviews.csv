Exams and cases are next to impossible and are graded vaguely without any type of reasoning behind them. I have never written a review online for a professor before, but this is my first because I need to tell the world how poor of an instructor she is.",11/13/2014,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,people,people

If you ask her more or something other than class, not helpful. Class is super boring and distracting. The participation tracking is absurd. Show-up doesn't mean anything unless you speak and then she'll mark your name.",11/08/2014,3,3.0,,3,Meh,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
