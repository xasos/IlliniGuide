N/A,average,good,average,0,16964269,0,,average,3,ECON000,"I have not taken a course with Dan, but know him well.  He's a brilliant guy, but I think he expects his students to take responsibility for themselves much as he did when coaching sports.  If you want to be spoon-fed the answers, Dan's probably not the Prof for you.  The real world doesn't employ many people who need to be spoon-fed, though.",04/08/2010,5,5.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I came to him not knowing much about economics, and he helped me to the point to if I did decent on the final, I'd get a C- out of th class. Well, let's just say I won't be repeating that class! Get to know him on a personal level. He's a nice guy.",05/24/2006,5,5.0,,5,Meh,4,4.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,11647234,0,,poor,2,ECON302,"Awful professor!  His course has very little organization; his thoughts are even less organized than the course.  He talks about 1 topic then goes on a tangent, confuses the class and forgets what he was talking about.  Exams are impossible (50% ~ B- 1st exam ) and there's no help available for hw. Try to switch prof's if you get him!!",04/03/2006,4,4.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
