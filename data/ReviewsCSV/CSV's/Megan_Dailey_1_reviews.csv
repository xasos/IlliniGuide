Not Mandatory,average,average,average,0,25817864,1,,average,3,ANSC222,Her exams are now multiple choice! She's really willing to help you if you approach her.  I personally loved her and she allowed us to correct our exams and homework if we scheduled office hours with her. Her exams were fair but you do have to think a bit out of the box and apply your knowledge rather than just memorizing the information.,12/24/2015,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A-,,person,people

She can be slightly rude . For the final project I did what she asked but gave me rude feed back. She is very knowledgeable and she does want you to do well, but can be rude about it at times.

She is extremely knowledgeable about so much in her subject area, and really has an interest in her students.  Go see her if you need anything.  I would not have wanted anyone else to teach the physiology section.  All you need to do is study and take notes.",12/12/2015,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person

Her tests are NOT multiple choice, however this gives you the chance to better explain why you believe your answer is correct.  She is always available for questions and is extremely smart and good at explaining things.  ",04/21/2015,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,1,24155678,0,,average,2,ANSC222,"Dr. Dailey seems to expect everyone to be a master at anatomy and physiology.  Her tests (especially on neuro system) are extremely tough, and she is a very rough grader.  READ HER INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY.  It seems like she thrives off of being able to deduct points from your assignments.  I would NEVER take her again for anything.",12/20/2014,5,5.0,,3,Low,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person
