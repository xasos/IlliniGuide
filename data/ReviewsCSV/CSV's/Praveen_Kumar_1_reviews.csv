N/A,poor,good,poor,0,24084579,0,,poor,1,CEE202,"This is by far the hardest Statistics class to understand just because of the layout of the class. Exams are nothing like the HW problems in the book along with Wiley Plus. He drops an exam out of 3 still not helpful. The notations from his lectures to the books are different, which makes it harder to understand.",12/15/2014,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

The online website we used (WileyPlus) was a hot mess. His tests were also really hard if you've never taken a probability course before. Overall, a very bad experience.",12/12/2014,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,poor,0,24029228,0,,poor,2,CEE202,Extremely unhelpful and cancelled office hours frequently.  Tests were very difficult and had questions that weren't anything like our homework or lecture examples.  He used different notation and equations than our textbook which made following him in lecture difficult.  Doesn't post any lecture notes or solutions to homework or tests online.   ,12/11/2014,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
