N/A,good,poor,good,0,19383605,0,,good,4,ECON302,By far the easiest 302 professor.  This class was way easier than 102 and 103.  He basically gives you the answers on the tests on compass and the homeworks are very simple.  You  drop your lowest test.  Also a lot of extra credit.  This really should not be a 300 level class.
