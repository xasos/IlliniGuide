While Eric is very good with the academics, he is not understanding about private personal hardships. He expressed extreme hostility toward me when I requested a drop. If you are thinking of dropping this class, watch out. That's all I am saying.",04/06/2010,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Go to the lectures, they're interesting. The discussion sections were very helpful. Good class but the exams were too hard, notecards helped me.",01/20/2010,5,5.0,,4,Meh,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Definitely go to lecture! Definitely read the text! Also now he sends out emails with what to study for the exams (which are pretty hard,but manageable as long as you study).",01/13/2010,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
