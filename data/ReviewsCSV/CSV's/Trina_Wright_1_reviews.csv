Mandatory,average,average,good,0,26213563,0,,good,3,CMN396,"Great professor. Her lectures are the opposite of boring, she is hilarious! She tends to go on tangents and may not cover all the material needed to know in class. Material is pretty interesting, but the book gets repetitive. Easy class. 3 tests and a weekly one question response which is easy. I highly recommend this class! You will love her!!",03/31/2016,2,2.0,,5,N/A,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,B+,,people,people

Make your opinions heard and she'll definitely lie you. For the every day responses just skim the readings and make up what you can adding in personal experience and you'll do great.",08/17/2010,2,2.0,,5,Low,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

She believes that she is &quot;too nice&quot; and is on an ego trip trying to prove to her students that she is a credible professor. Likes to flaunt her accomplishments. No room for mistakes. Says she understands what students go through and that life happens but when something actually happens, she does not understand.",03/21/2008,5,5.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
