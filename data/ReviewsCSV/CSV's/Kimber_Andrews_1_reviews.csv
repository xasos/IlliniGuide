N/A,good,poor,good,1,21135962,0,,good,5,ART250,"Take the class with her! She makes the class interesting and is also very understanding and flexible and will help you if you go talk to her. Class is 3 hours long but time goes by fast in this class. Also she lets the class out early on most days. Class is not hard at all. As long as you show that you worked hard, you will get a good grade.",12/20/2012,1,1.0,,5,Low,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
