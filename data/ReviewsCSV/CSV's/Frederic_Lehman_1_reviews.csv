N/A,good,average,average,0,16153279,0,,good,4,HIST225,"Interesting teacher and person, though it's not easy to take notes during the class. He did tend to repeat himself a lot, and went on tangents a lot too. If you're interested in the history of SE Asia, he's had all the experience. Otherwise, consider a different class. Don't buy the books, just rent them for the papers.",08/26/2009,3,3.0,,3,Low,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,12091,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

A mix between Ernest Hemingway and a British explorer in 1800's India, he is completely fascinating. Who cares about the class or the grade or any of that crap.

Prof. Lehman is a nice guy, you may find his word choice and presence pretty funny (he dresses and talks like the hunter from Jumanji.) Unfortunatly he is extremely unclear with his tests and his lectures are so abstract they are not worth attending.",05/23/2006,1,1.0,,2,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,N/A,N/A,12091,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
