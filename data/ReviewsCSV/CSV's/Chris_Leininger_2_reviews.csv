N/A,average,good,average,0,13082894,0,,average,2,MATH231,"Teaches with large technical math terms like the textbook does. Might as well just read the definition of the theorems instead of going to class because thats pretty much all he does. Its hard to understand. Doesnt give any info on why he takes points off on tests, just does it. If you have to take him, youll survive, but dont look forward to it",04/30/2007,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Just ask questions if you don't understand, he will help or at least give you some hints.

(One of his first students) His tests aren't too bad and he teaches very theoretically. That isn't a bad thing because I still remember everything he taught. He's willing to help in office hours. If he is teaching, take his class.",04/06/2006,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,11259067,1,,poor,1,MATH243,I had to drop this class because the teacher was soo difficult.  He is willing to help during his office hours...but he is sooo difficult to understand...and his class is too fast paced.  You'd have better luck taking Math 242 if you get this proffessor.  he has no teaching experience either...he started in fall of 2005.,12/25/2005,5,5.0,,2,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
