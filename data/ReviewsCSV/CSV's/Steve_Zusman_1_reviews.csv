N/A,good,average,good,0,13627497,0,,good,5,PHIL101,I have never had (and can't imagine that I ever will have again) a philosophy instructor that is so energetic and enthusiastic in his teaching.   And especially important for philosophy instructors in particular was his ability to explain insanely complex ideas in the most clear and lucid manner possible. Engaging as well as enjoyable!,11/09/2007,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,12793962,0,,good,5,PHIL101,What a great guy!  He really knows his stuff and is very approachable!  Very friendly and funny.  I made sure I came to this class every day because he makes it worth it! This was my favorite class and the tests are simple if you pay attention in class and take notes/do the readings.  He will make a great professor!,01/18/2007,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Exams were slightly lengthy, but very doable (as long as you came to class and took down notes). This is the only course that I never missed a class for in college - simply because he is that good. Take his PHIL 101!",01/15/2007,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Funny quirks to look for: pointing to board where stuff was the previous lecture, getting into long, slightly off-topic discussions, his personal opinion about the recollection theory and Emerson. :)",06/10/2006,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
