N/A,poor,average,poor,0,11267216,0,,poor,1,PHIL105,This class is BORING!!!  Sussman talks and talks forever about nothing and the TAs are very unhelpful also. He is not easy on the eyes or ears!  You do not need to attend the lecture becuase Sussman does not even know what he is talking about!  BEWARE OF THIS CLASS...IT IS HORRIBLE AND BORING!!!,12/27/2005,3,3.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He has no clue how to come down to a student's level.  Don't take his class.

The readings are absolutely horrible and ambiguous.  Sussman rambless all lecture and you never really know what he's talking about.  You can still get a good grade as long as you do well on the 3 papers, each worth 25%.",12/02/2005,2,2.0,,2,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
