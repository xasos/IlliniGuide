Not Mandatory,good,average,good,1,23185279,0,,good,4,ACCY515,A lot of topics covered within the class so keep up! She assigns a lot of outside readings and articles. There are a lot of slides. The grading is a bit nit picky so watch your wording with questions. Overall the class was fair just a lot of topics covered and sometimes it can be hard knowing which one is the most relevant for the exams.,05/07/2014,3,3.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
