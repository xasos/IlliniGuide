Mandatory,average,average,average,0,24786171,0,,good,3,IB302,"I thought her portion of IB 302 was very well done. She covered about 5-6 lecture units per exam, and sure enough there were 5-6 questions on the exam--one from each unit. The questions themselves were basically just regurgitating exactly what she taught us in lecture. Gives RIDICULOUSLY long study guides for the exams though.

N/A,average,average,average,0,21486169,0,,average,3,IB302,She speaks fast and if you didnt catch it you'd be lost. Im currently taking IB 202 and 302 with her teaching 1/2 of the material..and all I have to say is you have to attend lecture to get the notes..that is basically what is on the exam.,04/04/2013,3,3.0,,3,Meh,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The only requirement for getting a good grade in this class is ""memorize and regurgitate"" style learning.  Really fun class though.

Her notes are really helpful, I brushed up on my artistic biology skills.  She also makes you think her tests are gonna be very hard with her study guides, then you overstudy and they are easy.  But thats good!  You learned something.",05/29/2009,4,4.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

However, she's an awesome professor! She's quirky and funny and makes lecture interesting.",04/16/2009,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,good,good,0,13192210,0,,good,4,IB202,"She has a different type of teaching method where she writes every note on the board. This may seem tedious, however it helps you to understand the information better. Overall, she is an extremely nice teacher who wants her students to succeed at her classes. Tests aren't that bad either. Negative- talks way too fast",05/20/2007,4,4.0,,5,Low,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
