Mandatory,poor,average,average,0,25820106,0,,poor,1,GWS201,"Grades are very arbitrary and she is incredibly disorganized. Assigns some religious reading that has little relevance to the topic at hand, and she is very unclear about assignments. She is very defensive as if she thinks students think she is a bad professor and by doing so, is a bad one. I really wanted to like her but she was awful.",12/24/2015,3,3.0,,3,It's my life,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people

She would put it in and then leave. Then when she found out we were doing the same thing she lowered our attendance grades.

There's only 100 points in the class so you lose 10 points and kiss an A goodbye. You have to a ton of reading to get all the participation points and all of the readings are BORING AS ****.
