N/A,average,good,average,0,18229121,0,,poor,2,PHYS123,He is SO ANNOYING! He purposely drags out class when there is NO point in doing so. Makes jokes that are NOT funny. Insists on discussing simple topics for 15 minutes when 1 minute would be sufficient. Calls on people randomly because his class leadership doesn't stimulate discussion. Very poor choice of a teacher. Avoid him at all costs!,02/11/2011,4,4.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
