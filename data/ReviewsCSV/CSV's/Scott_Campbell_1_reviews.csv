He doesn't really open the class up for discussion and sticks to his interpretations of stories which sometimes seem rediculously insignificant.

He asked leading questions in class to get discussions going, but acted annoyed if someone talked about something that wasn't on his notes sheet. Plus, he made it obvious he didn't like girls as much as guys (who he chatted about weightlifting with).
