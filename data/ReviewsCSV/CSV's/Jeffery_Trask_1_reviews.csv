N/A,average,good,average,1,23682783,0,,average,2,INFOTECH,Dr. Trask is now at Lewis University and reads off the slides.  I didn't think to look at his former school to get an idea of who I am dealing with.  Be prepared for case studies galore.  It is nearly impossible to get a hundred on anything.  He marks off for not even answering a question that wasn't even on the homework.,10/22/2014,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person

You learn about the healthcare system in the United States and you can make this class so much interesting. However, he literally reads of the slide. Not a very good teacher. Does the minimum work as a teacher. Exams are too specific. Textbook reading is way to much.",03/07/2014,4,4.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Unfortunately he restructured the online version so its a ton of work, lots of readings, weekly quizzes, 2 papers, and the exams are extremely hard.

He doesn't even show up when guest lecturers come to class, which is pretty often. You will get 2/3 of the test material by going to the review day, but some test questions come out of left field.

You have to go to  the discussion cuz that's where the quizzes are. Exams are all multiple choice and he pretty much gives the an outline before the exam so that's helpful.  You dont really have to exert a lot of effort to get an A.,05/09/2007,1,1.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
