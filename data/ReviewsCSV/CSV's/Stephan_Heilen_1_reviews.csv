I never did a single reading for the class and came out with an A. The papers required minimal effort and only limited quotation from the readings.,11/17/2009,1,1.0,,4,Low,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,15989445,1,,good,5,CLCV116,This class is incredibly easy!  Yes there are a LOT of readings but Heilen goes over pretty much everything important from them in lecture.  Even if you don't go to class it is easy to get an A...he puts all his powerpoints on compass and goes over everything important the lecture before exams.  I definately would take another class with him.,06/24/2009,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,15879490,0,,average,2,CLCV116,"The hardest class I've ever taken! If you miss a lecture, there's no way of getting the information. In addition, it's a little difficult to understand his accent, especially with the complicated Roman names. Exams cover everything including readings (which are a whole lot). The professor himself is really great and nice, but the course is hard!",05/21/2009,4,4.0,,3,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,15789981,0,,average,2,CLCV116,"I came into this class with a relative interest in Roman history. The professor is extremely nice, and really takes the time out to help a student in need. As for the class, he teaches straight off of a typed sheet of notes, his tests are NOT easy, his paper criterian is demanding and toughly graded, and you really cannot afford to miss lecture.",05/07/2009,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,15693901,0,,poor,2,CLCV116,"Not a fun class. He reads from his lecture notes, hard to understand, refuses to post his notes online, and his tests are difficult. His papers are demanding, and the purchase of 5+ books is required, yet you rarely use any of them. VERY nice professor, but this class blows.",04/22/2009,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Basically, the lecture is like someone reading to you for an hour. Go to class and read the books.",04/12/2008,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
