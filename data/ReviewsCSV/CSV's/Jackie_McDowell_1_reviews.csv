There is a short 5 page paper and a debate that takes up some time but overall isn't bad. The final is on-line and a joke if you have all of your notes together. Entertaining class, easy A if you put forth some effort.",12/10/2008,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
