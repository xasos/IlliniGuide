She truly cares about her students and doesn't forget them, even if they happen to say hello a year after one's course with her ended. She really knows her stuff and is very passionate about what she does. If you can take one of her courses, do it. ",11/05/2014,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,person,people

I knew nothing about the subject beforehand, yet I felt her excellent ability to explain and her energy towards the subject made all the difference. There is as lot of reading and a good amount of writing, but going to lectures is what counts. Fascinating subject matter and great professor! Best I've had at UIUC so far.",05/05/2012,2,2.0,,5,Low,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
