He is an extremely talented thinker, and he is able to convey his knowledge succinctly to students. He is available to help if you fall behind in the course and his grading procedures are fair. He is not the most prompt with his grading, but the grading is well thought out and fair.",09/30/2010,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

His lectures are dull and he takes attendance, probably since no one would show up if he did not.  He feels that anyone who does not believe what he does is a &quot;skeptic&quot; and is not shy about saying they're misguided.

Expects you to understand things on the same level as him (even though intro class).  I took it with the understanding that we would be writing papers.  Instead he gave exams with MC, short answer, and essay.  This can be hard when it comes to a subject like this.
