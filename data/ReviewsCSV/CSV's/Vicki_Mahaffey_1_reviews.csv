Otherwise, her tangents can seem a bit random and winded. I learned a lot, particularly at the end, but the course required a lot of work to keep up and feel comfortable with the material.

Conference work repeatedly got derailed because she failed to look over my work when she said she would. Awful email communication. Unreliable in a lot of ways.
