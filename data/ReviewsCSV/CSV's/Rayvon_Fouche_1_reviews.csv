N/A,average,average,average,0,20209374,0,,poor,2,HIST264,His lecture slides are riddled with typos and that goes along with his lecturing. He constantly jumps from one point to the next trying to tie everything together. The info could be interesting but it's mostly boring. He's smart and I'm sure he'd be great for small discussion classes. Grading is fair but the TAs do that. I doubt he ever grades.,05/06/2012,2,2.0,,2,Meh,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The required reading can be alot but you can get most of the information from the lectures anyway. The biggest downside is the exams are all essay/free answer and are pretty tough.

He takes random attendance sometimes, and you need to attend 75% of the lectures to make sure you're grade doesn't drop. Understand the overall themes and you'll be more than fine.
