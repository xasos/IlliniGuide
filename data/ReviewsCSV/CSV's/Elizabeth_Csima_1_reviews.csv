Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,22968458,0,,poor,1,MA111,"She is by far the worst teacher I have ever had. She is more of a researcher than a professor. Always nervous and always makes mistakes. My friend and I both have her class and I end up getting better grades on things compared to my friend and my friend has a higher grade. Her grading is TERRIBLE! By the way, she's at the University of Kentucky now",03/31/2014,4,4.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,average,average,0,21414454,0,,good,3,MA322,"I thought she was very fair with her grading. She gives very generous curves on her tests. She gives us practice tests that are extremely similar to the actual exams, and it's really not that hard to receive a passing grade in her class. Sure, she depends on her notes and becomes flustered, but overall I don't think she's a bad professor!",03/15/2013,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

All this to get hired full time, perhaps there is a reason youâ€™re a visiting professor.  Here is an idea actually teach your students and perhaps stop depending on your notes so much.",03/10/2013,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She basically just walks you through each section exactly as the book outlines it, which is fine, but sometimes it'd be nice if she did more examples (I guess that's what discussion sections are for).
