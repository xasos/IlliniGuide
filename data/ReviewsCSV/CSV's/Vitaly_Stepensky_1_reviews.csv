N/A,good,average,good,0,15129669,0,,good,5,MCB315,Vitaly is by far the best teaching assistant I have ever had.  His explanation and detail on subjects really brings his audience to examine the material more closely and therefore bringing more interest into the very dry subject of functional histology. I wish he taught more classes because I would definitely take them.,12/08/2008,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

It really helps having a teacher who not only understands the material but is also passionate about what he does and the students he works with. I wish he could teach all my classes!
