N/A,good,average,good,0,20663635,1,,good,5,SHS120,I have had no problems with Dr. DeThorne. She's very sweet & kind & truly cares about her students. She's interesting & her class is easy to pay attention to. I don't know what that other person's problem was with her political correctness - she's great at teaching & that's what matters.

N/A,average,average,average,0,17631702,0,,average,3,SHS431,Too politically correct.  She is overly sensitive and cares too much about catering to people who are overly sensitive like herself.   She makes everyone buy a very large packet of articles (200+ pages) instead of posting them online for free.  It's a huge waste of paper and money and she doesn't seem to care about the cost to the environment.,10/05/2010,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
