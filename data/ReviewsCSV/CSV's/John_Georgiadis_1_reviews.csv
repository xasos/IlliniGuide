N/A,average,good,average,0,23245773,0,,average,2,ME300,Has pretty poor hand writing and used a document camera for the majority of the lectures and then posted those pages online. They typically aren't helpful to look at afterwards because there are arrows everywhere. Class was often entertaining even if I had no idea what his notes were saying because of his commentary.,05/14/2014,4,4.0,,4,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The homework was long and tedious because each problem had many steps and the problems were fairly unique.

Good personality, easily approchable for questions. But posts lecture notes online so class isn't required. Inclass test are tricky, but fundamental.
