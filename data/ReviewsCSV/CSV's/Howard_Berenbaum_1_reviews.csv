N/A,average,good,average,1,15835281,0,,poor,2,PSYC496,Prof. Berenbaum's lectures are rambling and he rarely sticks to the syllabus. He does not communicate with his TAs and his grading process is not uniform. The examples he gives in class are from his own research 90% of the time and are rarely connected to the material at hand. He's also condescending and incredibly frustrating.,05/14/2009,4,4.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
