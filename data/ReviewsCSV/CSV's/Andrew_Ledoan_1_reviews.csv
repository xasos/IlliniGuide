The tests were way too long, most people still there at the end. They were nearly impossible to finish unless you rushed. I have never had a past problem.  Homeworks very long and didn't count for much. Irritating.",12/21/2007,5,5.0,,2,It's my life,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Easy material becomes complicated cause of it, and he gets flustered trying to explain it.  It's simple enough material, he just complicates it.
