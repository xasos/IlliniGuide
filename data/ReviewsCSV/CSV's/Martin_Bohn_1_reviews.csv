His accent is kinda irritating in the beginning but then you get used to it.",02/26/2009,1,1.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
N/A,good,poor,good,2,14230828,0,,good,4,CPSC116,If you need a NW culture course and don't want to learn about some stupid religion or foreign land take this class.  The class is full of athletes if that tells you anything about the difficulty.  Professor Bohn is relly nice too and if you don't know anything about agriculture you can learn some basic concepts.,04/02/2008,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
