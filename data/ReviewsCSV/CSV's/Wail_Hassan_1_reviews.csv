Unlike some professors who LOVE to hear ""their voice"" in an essay, Wail wants you to put the effort and write from a new perspective. NEVER copy from notes being discussed in class. That get's you an A- or a B+. Also, talk in class and ""appear"" like you care. You will then learn a lot.",12/24/2014,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person

Reading for every class and a short (250 word) essay due online before each class about the reading (easy to fake). Very easy tests and people share notes on compass readily.
