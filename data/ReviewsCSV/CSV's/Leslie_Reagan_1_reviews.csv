Mandatory,average,good,average,0,24656381,0,,average,2,HIST172,All Depends on the Ta! Lectures are interesting but have to take notes by hand and she talks really fast. Must read the textbook because alot of test questions come from there. Hopefully get a good Ta or they can wreck your grade on the Papers. Gives extra credit. Tests are multiple choice and essay.

N/A,average,good,average,3,22228780,0,,poor,2,HIST172,She stands up in front of the lecture hall with a power point full of pictures and you can't use your computer to take notes. She makes you write down what she is saying but talks so fast and talks about random pictures that you have no notes to study from. She literally stands in front of the class and reads straight off a piece of paper.,10/29/2013,5,5.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
