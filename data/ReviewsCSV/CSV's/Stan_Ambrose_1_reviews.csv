Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,26294147,0,,poor,1,ANTH242,"The guy is super smart but he cannot teach a class. His lectures often have nothing to do with the readings, he's vague, he rambles and has tangents, and his class has very little structure. Again, he's very passionate and intelligent, he's just not good at articulating his message or going out of his way to make the course easier for students.",04/14/2016,5,5.0,,1,N/A,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,Not sure yet,,people,people
