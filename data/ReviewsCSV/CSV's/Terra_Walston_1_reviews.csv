N/A,good,average,good,0,17422609,0,,good,5,ENGL247,"She was legitimately my favorite teacher second semester. She is really helpful for assignments and such, but also tries to get to know you as a person. She also keeps class reasonably interesting and brings up good points in novels, she doesn't pick the typical novel either to read. Good class, good teacher, I don't regret taking Engl 247 at all.",07/15/2010,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Very available and willing to help you/look at drafts, etc. Attendance isn't mandatory, but a lot of what you discuss in class will be on the exams.

She's a rhet rollercoaster ride of great reading and even better attitude.  I really felt like she &quot;cared&quot; about me.
