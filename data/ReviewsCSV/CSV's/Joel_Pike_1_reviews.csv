The best part of class was when he ended a set of slides and then for a moment thought about going onto the next set...and when he let us go, everyone would exhale and cheer about finally getting out early.",08/26/2008,4,4.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Other than that, it really wasn't hard at all. Lectures are like death sometimes, so I only went on a grouptalk day.",01/18/2007,4,4.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,12600788,0,,poor,1,ACCT405,"He is absolutely the worst ACCY teacher on this campus.  Completely haphazard grading, no feedback on low grades, ridiculously poor timing of assignments and exams.  Spends no time on the most difficult parts of the course, tons of time on stupid sh*t.  Wastes time (goes the full 2 hours every day) and lots of awkward silences in class.",12/14/2006,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He just rambles on for two hours but never actually covers any material.  If you have an ounce of common sense you can do just fine without ever going to class.  Pike is just another example of the unbelievably awful accy teachers at U of I.",11/02/2006,3,3.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
