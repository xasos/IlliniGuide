N/A,good,average,good,0,23317957,0,,good,4,BTW250,"Debora is very fair and reasonable. She won't make you do a lot of busywork like some 250 TAs do. That being said, when she assigns homework, she expects you to do your best. The class isn't hard, but don't expect to get an A without working for it.",05/27/2014,2,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,average,poor,average,0,23132365,0,,average,3,BTW250,"She is super chill, but then when it comes to the grading, OMGGGGGGG she is so harsh. Some trivial spelling mistakes can give me an A-. Don't expect to learn a lot from her. However, if you want a easy class and a okay grade, her class is a fit.",04/30/2014,1,1.0,,2,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people
Mandatory,poor,average,poor,0,22115562,0,,poor,1,ENGL255,"TA for ENGL 255. She was terrible at keeping discussion sections interesting. She would ask a question and then basically just shrug off the silence. You know a TA doesn't care about their students if they say ""this is your discussion, not mine"" when no one answers her questions in class.",09/11/2013,3,3.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,B,,people,people
