As long as you do not cheat or take advantage of him like MATH 408 did then you should have no problems with him. Very helpful especially during office hours and is very good at teaching the material.

I took more than 85 credits so far, and you were the worst teacher I've ever met, congrat. Most inaccessible, rude, and unhelpful.
