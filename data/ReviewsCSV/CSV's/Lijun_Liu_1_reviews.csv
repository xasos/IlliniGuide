Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25798180,0,,good,4,GEOL107,Awesome guy. Iclickers are graded lightly. One 5 question reading quiz each week and a handful of HWs. Straightforward tests- dropped one midterm. He is really understanding about iClickers. A few times he changed his PowerPoint on the spot to reword a confusing question. He stayed after to clarify lecture points and knows most students by name.,12/22/2015,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people

Sometimes can be unclear during lecture but is enthusiastic when answering questions. People who can't understand him are sitting in the back, he is perfectly fine. Those who try to prove wrong are attempting to bend class to them",12/21/2015,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Iclicker points are part of your grade and pretty easy, but sometimes he doesn't explain what the correct answer is which is kind of a pain, but overall he is a solid professor.",11/18/2014,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
