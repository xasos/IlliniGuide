Mandatory,good,good,good,0,26467812,1,,good,5,ARCH210,"This teach is very knowledgeable in the subjects she teaches. Although her tests are tough, if you pay attention in lecture and take notes, it is easy to pass. She very much emphasizes the information you will need to know for the tests. She is a challenging professor but a nice and intelligent person.",05/04/2016,4,4.0,,4,N/A,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,person,people
Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,26448809,0,,poor,1,ARCH210,"Heather Grossmann is not a good teacher. Although she is very intelligent and the materials in this class is pretty interesting, It is inevitable that you stay awake during class. She has a hard time articulating her ideas, and gives you a 400-level worth of class materials. Readings are useless, just review the recordings of her lecture.",05/03/2016,4,4.0,,1,N/A,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The exams are not only excessive memorization, but extremely hard for an introductory course and she only gives you about 4 days to prepare.",04/30/2016,5,5.0,,1,N/A,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person
