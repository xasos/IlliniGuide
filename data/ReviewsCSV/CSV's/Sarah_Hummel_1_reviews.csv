Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25394511,0,,good,5,PS397,"Her lectures are extremely interesting. She does a great job of incorporating different activities and videos so lectures never seem tedious. Do the readings, you'll get so much more out of the lecture. She's not that tough of a grader- if you satisfy her (very clear) rubric, you'll get an A or B. Plus she's so, freaking, adorable.
