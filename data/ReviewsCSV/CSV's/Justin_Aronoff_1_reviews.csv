Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25838605,0,,good,4,SHS280,"He is a great professor keeping the class engaged and you actually learn something. He uses a random name generator to call on students but as long as you try he is happy. I wouldn't even buy the book because I looked at it once. He has an extra credit assignment that is a lot of work, but it is worth it because it can boost your grade up to 5%.",12/28/2015,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people
