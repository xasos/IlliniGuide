The content was kind of all over the place but it was always interesting, and she's also a really nice person.",03/15/2016,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people

Not Mandatory,good,poor,good,1,22807664,0,,good,5,MACS100,Literally probably the easiest class in the history of easy gen eds!!! The median for the third exam was a 100%.. and she pretty much tells you in lecture what questions will be on the exam. Every true false question is always true.. she says so herself haha.

She wants everyone to get an A, and will drop grades or curve scores even though it's so incredibly easy. I really enjoyed most of the films we watched too.

They are almost all Asian and African American films, which does not fit the description of the class. Try and get a different teacher. She is odd and disorganized as well. Class is pretty easy, though.",10/09/2013,2,2.0,,1,It's my life,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A-,,people,people
