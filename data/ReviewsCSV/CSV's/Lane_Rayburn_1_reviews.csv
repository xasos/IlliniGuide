The material was interesting and there were pop quizzes so attendance was key, but he drops 3 quizzes. Only had 3 exams and he took all the questions from the quizzes and put them in the exams. 1 group project at the end but not bad.

Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,22894387,2,online,poor,1,CPSC213,He restructured the online class so it's not so easy anymore. Quizzes/exams are tough in that it's timed and you can only go through one question at a time and you cannot go back to previous questions! There's also fill in the blank where you need to type in the answer. Very passionate about the class but not an easy A class.,03/07/2014,4,4.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
