Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,22793293,0,,good,5,301,Easily my favorite professor I've had. He's very respectful towards his students and does a good job of pushing your writing and understanding of the course material. I never found him condescending. Certainly he is a well educated and highly intelligent guy but he doesn't let that control the discussions.
