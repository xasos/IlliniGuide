Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25912371,0,,good,4,PHYS213,"Budakian is a good teacher who has a solid understanding of Materials Science, Quantum and Thermal Physics. He tries his best to teach the class with experiments and images to make the already insipid topic, less mundane. One quality I really like about him is that he always accepts doubts and questions and answers them there or in a later lecture.",01/10/2016,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people

His lectures are extremely helpful and he explains things over and over so you can properly understand the concept. He encourages students to ask questions, so don't be afraid to.
