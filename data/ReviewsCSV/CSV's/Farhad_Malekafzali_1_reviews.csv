Teaches the stuff how it should be taught, not edited for textbooks. Yes, his class is hard, but you will come away from his class knowing the real side of a topic. Illinois will be at a loss if he leaves. Take his class for the material, not for the grade",12/07/2012,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
