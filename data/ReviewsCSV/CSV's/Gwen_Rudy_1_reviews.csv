Gwen is interested in what she teaches and is always prepared for class. Participation and online responses are easy points. Overall, Intro to Poetry taught by Gwen wasn't bad at all. Easy Gen Ed. and decent teacher.",05/23/2010,1,1.0,,3,Low,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,poor,good,0,12226518,0,,good,4,RHET105,"she was a really nice teach.  I never read the assignments before hand and I think she picked up on that because she rarely asked me for my opinion.  I got A's on 4/5 essays and the other a B, so it was really easy. All in all, she's very easy and pleasent teacher.",09/11/2006,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

My friends in rhet 105 classes always told me how they were swamped with work...with Gwen, you have the 5-6 required papers, and thats it. She is a pretty easy grader, as long as you follow the assignment. Shes a great teacher, and a fun class!",01/20/2006,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
