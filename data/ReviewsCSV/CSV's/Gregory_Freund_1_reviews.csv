N/A,good,average,good,2,21477929,0,,good,4,MCB493,"Awesome professor. If you have a chance to take a class with him you should. He really wants you to succeed and will take time to help you if you don't understand something. Class is all lecture based which does get sometimes dull, but he is funny which helps. Highly recommend this teacher.",04/02/2013,3,3.0,,5,Low,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
