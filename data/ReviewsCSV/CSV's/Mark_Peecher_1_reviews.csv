Not Mandatory,average,good,average,0,26633333,0,,average,2,ACCY405,"Nice guy but is way too harsh on tests and group projects, when they're both highly subjective.  Kinda rambles during class lectures and it's hard to figure out what's actually important.  Easy to do well if you pay attention, but you'll probably do way worse than you thought you did on tests just because of how they're worded and graded.",05/22/2016,4,4.0,,4,N/A,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,good,average,good,1,23306640,3,,good,4,ACCY405,"Materials taught in Accy 405 is not easy. However, Peecher is willing to help and try to make it as easy as possible for his students. There are often extra credit opportunities, and he is really quick in addressing his students' issues and answering questions. I recommend him over other 405 professors.",05/23/2014,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,B,,people,person
N/A,average,average,average,0,14930333,4,,average,2,ACCY405,"Peecher is a nice guy. He really loves what he does, but auditing is a pretty dry topic, and Peecher makes it dryer. He likes to put the class to work, he expects you to try really hard, but you probably won't remember or use anything from class in the real world. But I guess that's just the way college is. BTW Peecher is a die-hard Republican.",11/03/2008,3,3.0,,3,Low,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,average,average,average,0,13994492,0,,average,2,ACCY405,"Prof. Peecher uses a lot of jargon and acronyms which makes him difficult to understand. He also expects you to read a lot of articles, some of which are a bit outdated. You just have to do what you can to make it through the course. I don't even remember much of what we went over, but I think that's typical of UIUC accounting courses.",01/14/2008,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
