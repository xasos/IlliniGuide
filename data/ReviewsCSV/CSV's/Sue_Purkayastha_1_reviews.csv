People often ask her questions and if she doesn't know the answer, she spends 20 minutes trying to figure it out! Also, completely UNREACHABLE. She admittedly doesn't respond to emails or phone calls. Good LUCK",10/15/2009,2,2.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She acts like none of her students have ever been exposed to the simple concepts we all learned way back in jr. high. Makes math errors such as calculation slope as change in x over change in y and adding numbers wrong.
