Fireman gives you every chance to ace the class, including tons of extra credit, around 7 practice exams per exam, and goes over multiple examples per topic.

N/A,good,average,good,0,21163535,0,,good,5,STAT100,Fireman was GREAT!! I really want to stress that this class definitely isn't a easy A or Blow off class. There is homework twice a week. And that homework prepares you for the exams. But she also gives study guides for each exam. Exam 1-3 are fairly easy (If you study).
