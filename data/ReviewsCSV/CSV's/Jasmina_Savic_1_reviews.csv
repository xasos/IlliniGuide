She explains concepts well and makes it clear she considers your education important. She's usually pretty happy and upbeat.

I hope she gets hired on as  faculty because I think she has a real passion for teaching and she is an amazing person. By the way, her favorite Russian word is ""pilasos"", giggles will ensue.",09/11/2013,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
