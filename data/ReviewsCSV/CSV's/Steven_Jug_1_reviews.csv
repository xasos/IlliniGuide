He was always willing to answer questions and meet whenever. As well as being a fair grader, he was very explanatory in his remarks- kind, gentle and very nice looking. A true juggernaut in the fields of Soviet and gender history.",09/30/2008,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

His class runs like a third grade substitute teacher. He will make you question going in to this field, because he did and turned out so bad.",07/23/2007,1,1.0,,1,It's my life,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
