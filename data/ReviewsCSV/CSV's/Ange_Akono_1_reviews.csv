N/A,poor,average,poor,0,26606202,0,,poor,1,CEE360,"Grading on the first midterm caught everyone by surprise because the TA's were grading our homework in a different way previously. Horrible at explaining things and at one point wouldn't let the class ask questions until she was finished with her writeup because she was being very confusing. Class is not hard (builds on TAM 251, book is helpful).",05/18/2016,3,3.0,,1,N/A,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
Mandatory,good,average,good,0,26502467,0,,good,5,CEE360,"Very easy to understand, if you put in the time, you should expect to do well. Very lenient grading, as she cares more so about you understanding concepts rather than if you can type everything in the correct order on your calculator.  Her policies in general are also more than fair. If you ever go up to her she will be able to explain things well.",05/08/2016,2,2.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people
N/A,poor,average,poor,0,24976819,0,,poor,1,CEE300,"She has very specific requirements for her homework that are just formatting, so it's just unnecessary busy work - due every lecture.  The course itself isn't too hard because there are 4 exams for 10% each, and she repeats a lot of the iClicker questions.  Lab reports are a burden, but they graded more easily as the semester went on.",06/18/2015,3,3.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Homework is due 3 times per week, which is more of a formatting exercise than actual engineering inquiry. Labs are interesting, but reports are VERY intensive.
