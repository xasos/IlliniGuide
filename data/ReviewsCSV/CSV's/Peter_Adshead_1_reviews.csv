Not Mandatory,good,average,good,2,26153557,0,,good,5,PHYS325,"Adshead is an entertaining lecturer, and very knowledgeable of the subject matter. He consistently reminds students to ask questions in lecture, and provides thorough responses. It seems as though he really cares about his students learning the material, but like any course, you'll need to be willing to put in the work.",03/17/2016,3,3.0,,4,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

If the clicker questions reflected anything about how the class was doing, it wasn't looking good for him. Around 2/3 of the class would get the clicker questions wrong, and he STILL wouldn't stop to explain them. Avoid him",10/29/2015,4,4.0,,3,It's my life,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,WD,,person,person

Don't be too offended if he goes off about the class's i-clicker mistakes; he's much more helpful if you ask questions. He's very good at explaining the mathematical side of physics.
