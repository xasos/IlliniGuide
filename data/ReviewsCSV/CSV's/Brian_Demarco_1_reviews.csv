N/A,good,good,good,0,20325175,0,,good,4,PHYS102,"For a 100 level class, the material is very challenging. You have to stay on top of it all semester. 3 hour exams weren't bad, but the cumulative final was brutal & was worth 25% of your grade. Demarco was really good at explaining the material & enjoyed answering q's.  Much more interesting than 101, but prepare to spend lots of time studying.",05/21/2012,4,4.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

But he is a good professor who takes his time to explain things. Go to every lecture, book is not necessary, and buy the slideshow packet; everything is in there and otherwise it's impossible to take notes.

N/A,poor,good,poor,0,16610097,0,,poor,1,PHYS140,Theres a reason why the former professor of this class gave extra credit like crazy. Its a very tough class for something thats supposed to be rudimentary physics for non-majors. Demarco just made the class even more ridiculously tough. Don't take this course choose another class.

I had never taken physics before this and went in with next to no interest, but I was actually sad when the semester was over!  Prof Demarco does a great job of keeping lectures interesting and really relating concepts to every day life.

Note taking wasn't possible and a lot of the demos were unreasonable and didn't pertain to or help with the subject. Kind of arrogant. But, it's an easy quant II credit and there are so many people in the class you're going to know someone else for sure--that makes it easy to study.
