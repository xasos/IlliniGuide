Mandatory,average,good,average,0,26588016,0,,good,3,ACE270,"Gunderson's exams are terrible.  You need to basically memorize every lecture slide for the exams.  No multiple choice, all essay questions.  The only grades he gave were 4 exams and 1 8-10 page paper.  You have to work really hard for your grade in this class.  Pretty funny guy though.",05/16/2016,4,4.0,,4,N/A,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B+,,people,people

Though there is no homework on a daily basis, the three tests are nearly impossible to study for, given that he and his notes both make zero sense.  I swear that sometimes he is speaking a different language. I will say though that he is quite entertaining. Nonetheless I have learned absolutely nothing",04/10/2014,4,4.0,,2,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The tests were too open-ended, and if you didn't answer to match his opinions on welfare, taxes, etc. you're screwed. TA was hardly there and not helpful. Most people were pissed when he handed tests, papers back because the grading was so unfair. Take something else.",08/31/2010,5,5.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
N/A,average,good,good,1,17188824,0,,good,3,ACE270,"He wears nice sweaters.  Exams are short answers, and hes a terrible grader. He will ask 3 part question and give you little or no credit if you get 2 out of 3 parts right.  He is also very picky about his answers and the grading is VERY subjective.  No homework though.  Heavily weighted 10page paper at the end, but I got a 100% cause I tried hard",05/12/2010,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
N/A,poor,average,poor,0,17162957,0,,poor,1,ACE270,Pretty much nothing is posted on compass so If you miss class you're boned.  Yes lots of EC but this is only to make up for the fact that he grades unnecessarily hard on the exams which are all open ended and some what vague plus there is a 10pg paper which is just a headache.  Not sayin you cant get a good grade just not worth the time and effort.,05/10/2010,3,3.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Prof. Gundersen's a cool guy and keeps class interesting by breaking it up with random funny remarks. He's kind of like the educational version of Conan O'brien... except he's not on TV, but then again neither is Conan. I'd recommend the class.",04/09/2010,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Lots of extra credit. Material covered is pretty easy, although you really need to memorize things to do well on exams. Says attendance is required, but he only takes it when he hands things back.",05/08/2009,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
