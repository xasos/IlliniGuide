Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,24795859,0,,poor,1,PSYCH210,"Her lectures are really difficult to understand. She has a very heavy accent. Her lectures don't have logic. She usually speak really loudly at the beginning of a sentence. It usually sounds like ""SO......."". I make the rest ..... because you can't really hear it! Her grammar is strange. It's always difficult to tell what she is trying to say. ",05/11/2015,4,4.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Exam questions are worded in strange ways to try to trick you.
