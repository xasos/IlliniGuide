The French literature was diffucult for me, but he made it bareable.  He was lenient with the second novel we were  &quot;supposed&quot; to read.  Fair exams.

A rare instructor that presents all of the material and encourages students to make up their own minds (unlike most who only present what they find interesting and make students memorize everything they say).
