He's a big deal in data mining, and he's good at explaining the concepts, although sometimes how he writes his explanations and problems is slightly ambiguous. He's a super nice guy and his enthusiasm for the subject mixed with his accent and demeanor make him kind of charming and unintentionally funny.

Everything was good...until the midterm where few students were cheating and he did nothing. This event happened again in Final exam. Seriously?

Probably easiest class to cheat during the mid term and final exam, because there is only 1 proctor for both cases. (for midterm, He was the only one proctoring 120 students) Actually saw few students cheating, which makes it just unfair for everyone.
