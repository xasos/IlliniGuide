Not Mandatory,average,good,average,0,22348220,0,,average,3,ARTH111,"She's really knowledgable and passionate about the subject. But it's really hard to get an A especially if you also have a hard essay-grading TA, which I did! You have to read the textbook super carefully and thoroughly to do well on exams. She is scary on lecture and gives 5 exams/semester and sometimes tests on things not yet covered in lecture!",11/19/2013,4,4.0,,2,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,average,average,0,20364407,0,,average,2,ARCH210,It is absolutely critical to stay awake in her class. I didn't do any reading and still got an A because I got all the answers to her tests in the lecture. She doesn't care about the little details like when it's built but rather the big picture and that's what her tests are based on. She also passes out extra credit for coming to class.,05/30/2012,2,2.0,,4,Low,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She expects you to know every single word she says, but nobody can ever get everything she says. Also, she even knows that she a &quot;Pain in the ass&quot;, because she told the class those exact words.

N/A,average,good,average,1,19212346,0,,poor,2,ARCH210,She made the class more difficult then EVER. She's insanely passionate about arch. history and goes through lectures VERY VERY fast. Her tests are difficult and she grades very hard. I was a sophomore in studios and this was my hardest class because of her. Her study guides for the tests are useless. I do not suggest taking any classes with her.,11/10/2011,5,5.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
