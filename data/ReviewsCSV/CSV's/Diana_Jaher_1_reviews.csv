She knows what she is talking about and has a great deal of knowledge about films you watch. Overall interesting and easy class!",05/04/2016,1,1.0,,4,N/A,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25964227,0,,good,4,MACS261,"She's overall a great professor. Her instructions are typically easy to follow and the tests are all open notes, so going to class which is mandatory helps so you can take good notes. She also doesn't mind if you take pictures of the slides.  The essays were the only things that were difficult to do really well on.",01/19/2016,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

She knows what's she's talking about and because of that, she grades hard since she knows her stuff and also because she's watched, like, all the films you'll probably write about",12/16/2015,2,2.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Her grading is very hard, but there are only two papers, a midterm, and a final, so not much time is spent on homework or studying. She docks grade if you miss more than 3 classes, so be sure to show up. Movies she chose were very good and she knew a lot of information about them.",05/10/2015,3,3.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

On the first, she allows rewrites, but she makes things so much more difficult than necessary which is super annoying.

Long lectures for the screenings, which were also late at night. Attendance was mandatory and taken every class period. She zooms through slides and doesn't post them online. Very nice, but the class was harder than it needed to be. She has an IMDB page!",12/11/2014,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
