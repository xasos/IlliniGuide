N/A,average,good,average,0,14756787,0,,average,3,CHEM104,Reading through most of these comments I would have thought the class wouldn't be too difficult and relatively easy to understand.Â  After taking the class I thought Hummel talked really fast and the exams were hard. I don't know if most of these people just love chemistry but I do NOT agree with the majority of the very positive student feedback,08/19/2008,5,5.0,,3,Low,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The exams are not bad at all- just make sure you take your time and read the questions and you will only get a few wrong! He is hilarious and explains things clearly.

He makes the material easy to understand and occasionally will let you out early.
