N/A,good,average,good,0,25522633,0,,good,4,SWOK670,"There was no 10-20 page research paper required for this class. The class consisted of 2 open book quizzes, 6 groups assignments (article critiques) and 1 poster presentation. Never used the book. PowerPoint lectures were short, and concise and readily available on BB. She is a GREAT professor. Easy A. Would highly recommend!

Tests were easy, considering she literally gives you the topics that will be on there. If you need an extension, talk to her. She's very understanding and even offered to write an LOR. Bottom line, if you don't pass, it's your own fault.",04/29/2015,1,1.0,,5,Low,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,person
