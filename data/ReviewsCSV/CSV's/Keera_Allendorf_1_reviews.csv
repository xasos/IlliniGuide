Not Mandatory,average,poor,average,0,22728412,0,,average,3,SOC280,Class is extremely boring. Notes can be found online or in the textbook. Exams are okay. Grading scale is very unusual. Professor Allendorf makes a lot of mistakes and argued that a 100 out of 150 was a 100%. This was the first class that I ever took that had a down curve. Will not take another class from her.,01/09/2014,1,1.0,,2,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,B+,,people,people

She is extremely clear in her explanations and does her best to make sure the students understand the material. Her tests are very similar to the homework and there are never any curveballs on them.

Homework is easy if you pay attention. Discussion sections are absolutely a waste of time though. 4 exams, none are too difficult if you know the content.

No attendance, no extra credit, no curving. Don't really need to buy the book even though she says you do to get the cd. She is nice but can be tricky and a stickler to her own rules.",05/06/2011,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
