Exam questions were ambiguous--a few of the answer choices could be correct, depending on the context in which the question was taken (subjective multiple choice). Left her work up to her TAs--both tried hard, but could not make up for the incompetence of the prof.

N/A,good,good,average,0,11632585,0,,average,4,AFRO100,Do not go into this class thinking it is an easy gen. ed.  This has been my hardest class because of the fact that what she states in lecture gets mis-worded on the tests.  Laughs about trick questions.  Cancels class or has T.A.s administer quizzes so that she does not have to be there.  Knows how to speak; doesn't know how to write tests.
