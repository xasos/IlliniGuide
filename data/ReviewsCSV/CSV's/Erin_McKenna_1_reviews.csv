However, you need to do the readings in order to do well on the i-clickers, and there are a lot of points given for those per day so try not to skip lecture.  I did well in the class, except for the midterm exam... I studied over 12 hours and got a D- on it. Do the extra credit essay. I regret I didn't",05/06/2016,4,4.0,,1,N/A,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Asks students to read way too much for a gen ed and then asks specific questions on the readings on exams. Adds unnecessary difficulty in areas just so the class doesn't seem too easy. A lot of easy EC, though.",01/17/2016,3,3.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people

She is very mean and unfair. However, the whole class is out of almost 1300 points and the grading scale is out of 1000, so anything above like a 930 is an A, which is pretty dope. I don't recommend this class but geneds suck",05/21/2015,2,2.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,person

She speaks faster during lecture than I have ever heard a person talk before and she doesn't give you direct access to the slides. Lecture consists of you not even listening and just trying to copy information. ",03/11/2015,2,2.0,,3,Meh,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person
