Mandatory,good,average,good,1,26636134,0,,good,5,PSYC414,"PSYC/NEUR 414 is a very straightforward class. You have to go to lecture and type out detailed notes, since the slides are missing information. Tests are fair, there's no curve, and he doesn't give minus grades so a 90% is A, 80% is B, so on. Don't buy the textbook. He doesn't even assign readings. Just go to lecture and you will do fine.",05/23/2016,2,2.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,person
Not Mandatory,good,good,average,2,24157617,1,,good,5,PSYC210,"Honestly, I thought he was an amazing lecturer. Attended every single day and knew from the beginning that I needed to hang on his every word. I STILL think his exam was way too specific. I mean, I had an A in that class until I took his test,  got a 75. Contacted him to ask if we could go over where I went wrong, and he refused to meet me. :(",12/20/2014,4,4.0,,2,It's my life,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,C,,person,people

You CANNOT rely on PowerPoints alone. Overall a great professor. His exam was very straightforward with no surprises.",05/14/2014,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

You have to go to class though, because most things he covers aren't on the slides. If you show up, take notes, and review them before the exam you should be fine. Not super easy, but overall a quality class.",03/20/2014,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

He was very nice, answered any questions, and it seemed like he really cared that his students understood the material. You don't need to buy the book! don't buy it, just go to lecture and you will be fine",05/22/2013,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He answers your questions, goes over old slides if you ask, and he even has a review class before every exam -- you really can't lose.
