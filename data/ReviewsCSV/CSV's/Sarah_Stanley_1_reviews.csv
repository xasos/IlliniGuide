Her TED days are horrible and unorganized, and skipping class will screw you over because those TED days are worth a ridiculous amount of the grade. I want to retake Psych with a different teacher so I can actually learn something.",12/15/2014,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
