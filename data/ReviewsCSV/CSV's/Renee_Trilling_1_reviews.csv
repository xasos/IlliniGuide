Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24542234,0,,good,5,209,"Can get away with spark noting pretty much everything, important in lectures to note what quotes she puts on the  board from the texts because there is a quotation identifying section on the exams that is a little tricky. Tests were pretty easy and no real papers besides one page responses due once a week for 8 weeks. ",04/03/2015,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Even though lecture was not mandatory, it had a lot of necessary background information that was helpful for the readings.

N/A,good,good,good,0,18839656,0,,good,5,ENGL301,I took both 209 and 300 with her and loved her. She really puts in the time to give you feedback and doesn't come off like she has more important things to be doing than teaching. She does grade hard though so don't expect an easy ride.,07/21/2011,4,4.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I took an honors seminar with her afterwards and she even made medieval lit interesting. Just make sure to keep up on reading and participate A LOT.
