Not Mandatory,average,average,average,1,25646474,16,,average,3,STAT430,Jeff's probably the most laid back professor I've ever had.  What I liked was that he didn't design impossible exams - he was more concerned with making sure we understood the material enough to demonstrate competence and wasn't out to trick us.  8 homeworks and 3 take home exams (all R coding pretty much).  Super nice guy!  Would take again.,12/11/2015,2,2.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,3,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person

Prof's notes were sometimes irrelevant to hw, so I had to read the mediocre textbook, which happens in 400-level course, so it wasn't horrific.
