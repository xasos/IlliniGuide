Workload is staggering, but large. Weekly quizzes in this class are rather difficult for just being weekly quizzes. His patience is fleeting, but he does care and tries to do what he can.",04/05/2006,4,4.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

All of his tests are half in class/half take home.  If you aren't retarted you'll get an A on the take home every time.  Definately look for classes taught by this Indian God...",12/13/2005,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
