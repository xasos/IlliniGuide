He doesn't put slides on compass so you need to be there and take good notes. The one HDFS class I didn't get an A in because I guess I underestimated how much I needed to study. But he's nice & will re-explain things you don't get. But: no study guides ",12/13/2014,4,4.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

If you go over the notes and READ the chapters that go with the notes, you can get an A on the exams. Projects are easy. There are not many As on the exams  . They definitely require you to study.",04/27/2010,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
