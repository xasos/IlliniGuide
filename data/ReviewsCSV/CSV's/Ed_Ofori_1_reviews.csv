N/A,good,average,average,0,20224857,0,,good,4,MOTOR262,He is a good and nice teacher. Lots of lecture quizzes but you get all points for just showing up. Exams questions seem to have multiple possible answers but not to hard. Kind of boring but overall an easier class then most kin classes. Discussion classes are a joke but easy. Just the kind of stuff that makes you irritated to do.,05/08/2012,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,poor,good,0,19301402,0,,good,5,KINE262,"I had him for the motor control and development class, and he was very cool and funny. His lectures are very long and pretty boring, but if you read the assigned textbook pages you will definitely be fine. I read the assigned pages and didn't pay attention in class or read the lectures and got a 88 on the 1st exam. The book was the most helpful thing to me.  :)",11/22/2011,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
