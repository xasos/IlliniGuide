N/A,good,poor,good,0,15636123,0,,good,4,CMN101,First impression was not great. She talked about her cats and political science a lot. She is ridiculously easy on grades and a genuinely nice person. Highly recommend to take her section if at all possible. I'm fairly sure that everyone in our section will end up with an A.,04/10/2009,1,1.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
