N/A,average,average,average,0,17221740,0,,average,3,IB429,Class seemed fair enough- three exams & you get to drop your lowest one- however the final (which is 50% of the total grade) was extremely difficult and dropped the grades of not only myself but also everyone else that I knew in the class.  A lot of the questions seemed open to interpretation so I don't know that studying any more would have helped,05/17/2010,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Class is required because he writes everything on the board. Exams are all multiple choice and there a lot of videos that you watch in lecture!
