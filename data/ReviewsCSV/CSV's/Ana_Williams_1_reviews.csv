N/A,good,poor,good,0,12652010,0,,good,5,PORT101,"Dr. Williams & Portuguese 101 are the BEST. She is really enthusiastic about teaching the class. She is really helpful and made class fun. I loved going to this class. I did not find her accent to be a problem at all. I HIGHLY recommend this class. You do have to be willing to work. Like with anything it takes work to learn, but very enjoyable.",12/20/2006,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I would definitley recommend this class.  It's really easy if you know spanish, because alot of the words/grammer is the same.  so you won't have to study much.  plus, Brasilians are hot!",11/01/2005,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Very little English used (none in the book), and easy to mix up with Spanish. I love Portugese but would not highly reccomend the class. Lot's of self learning necessary.",11/30/2004,3,3.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She's Brazilian and has a fairly thick accent, but she's very patient and pleasent so it's very easy to understand what she's explaining. Reccommended if you're sick of Spanish!!",09/24/2004,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,4,4.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
