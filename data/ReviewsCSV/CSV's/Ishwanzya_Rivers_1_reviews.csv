She refuses to answer questions if she believes they are answered on the syllabus and when grading, she is extremely nit-picky.

She is nitpicky on papers and has a specific way of doing things. If you don't adapt to her way, you won't get an A. Other students with different TAs had it much easier.",05/01/2009,5,5.0,,1,Meh,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
