We had to write 3 six page essays with no guidelines and he cared more about how you wrote than what you wrote about. He took attendance so I had to go, but I dreaded it everyday.

I thought it was going to be a basic 100 level blow off class, and instead it turned out to be a scattered off-topic course in which I learned nothing.  He had no syllabus and hardly any grades to even try to get a passing score.  This is not an easy A.",10/17/2008,4,4.0,,1,Meh,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
