N/A,good,poor,good,0,19218173,0,,good,5,SPAN141,"Not much has changed from the reviewer below me. I would say that the class is meant for people that have taken three or four years of Spanish prior, so if you have difficulty with comprehension when speaking with a native speaker, you might have to ask her to repeat herself because the class is taught in Spanish, but she helpfully does.",11/11/2011,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

This class basically reviews the grammar (not vocab) covered in SPAN122 and SPAN103, so the level of difficulty is comparable to those two classes. Online homework is annoying but easy. Grade consists of 2 exams, participation, written homework assignments, and online homework and discussions.",05/14/2011,2,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Readings are useless, I got an A and never read any. She's a fair/easy grader on papers. For a Spanish writing class, it's not bad at all! Sometimes her Spanish is a bit hard to understand, but it's doable. Shes really accommodating.",05/10/2010,1,1.0,,4,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
