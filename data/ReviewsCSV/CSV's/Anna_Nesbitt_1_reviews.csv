N/A,good,average,good,0,24210316,0,,good,5,ESE497,ESE 497 was one of the best courses I have taken. Both Anna and Rob made our trip to Costa Rica really enjoyable. I could tell they really care about us as students by going the extra mile to make the course more affordable and letting us explore our own interests in the class.,12/31/2014,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
Mandatory,good,average,good,0,23999780,0,,good,5,ESE497,"Not sure what the reviewer claiming that Dr. Nesbitt was unclear means.  Dr. Nesbitt was quite clear about her expectations with assignments and even provided rubrics for everything.  She did once change an assignment due date, because the majority of the class requested the change.  The trip was amazing and life changing!",12/09/2014,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,23223517,2,,poor,1,ESE497,"Went to Costa Rica as study abroad. She was unclear & vague with ALL assignments, & even changed what she wanted after deadlines already passed! Her expectations were ridiculous for the work she asked. Although she let us redo everything it was a waste of time b/c the assignment would be changed after turning it in. Not even worth the trip to me.",05/12/2014,4,4.0,,2,It's my life,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people
