N/A,good,average,good,3,23623770,0,,good,5,CHEM102,Dr. Overcash is the swaggiest teacher in all of Champaign-Urbana.

Not Mandatory,average,average,average,0,22611351,0,,average,2,CHEM102,Overcash was an average professor. First few exams were straight foward and easy. Third exam (Thermo) he failed to deliver the material correctly. Class average on the exam was 13/25. Final exam was a average in difficulty. Class average was a 60% onthe final. Class was tough but he curved the entire lass 8% or 80 points out of 1000. Don't pick him,12/19/2013,3,3.0,,4,Low,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,B,,people,people
