He is constantly corrected by students and regularly sends corrections of solutionsslides because he didn't do them correctly the first time.

Professor Beck is very approachable. The reason I rated helpfulness as a 5 is because this class will prepare you for the audit portion of the CPA (which is why you're taking this course).

Go to class because a lot of the grade is participation and he would just give my group good grades because we were there all the time and participated.
