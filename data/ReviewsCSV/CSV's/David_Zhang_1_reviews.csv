Exams are tough but manageable and there will be a large curve at the end.  Find past exams.  Be ready for long/difficult exams.  Book is n't necessary.  Take good notes, listen during reviews, practice the HW's and note examples.",05/19/2011,2,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,18587257,0,,good,4,ECE205,"I know it's hard to wake up for 8AM lecture, but this one is worth it. Gives very detailed notes, goes over good examples in class, and repeats the most important info. Exams were on the hard end of the spectrum, but that's more from having 1 hour for 4 problems than anything else. Whole class is curved and online HW is very do-able, especially with the TAs online helping out. One minor note: the textbook is organized very differently than the professor's notes, so be careful studying from it.",05/12/2011,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
