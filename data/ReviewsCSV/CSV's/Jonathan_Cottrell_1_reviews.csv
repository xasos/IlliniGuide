N/A,average,poor,average,0,23469839,0,,average,3,PSYC245,"He made a class that already had extremely dry material even drier. Awkward speaker, not super personable. The class was easy if you read over the slides and used the study guides he gave you. We had subs a few times throughout the class and they seemed to be much more comfortable teaching than he was.",07/24/2014,1,1.0,,2,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Only offers extra credit if you are already doing well but you have to do the extra credit before being graded. Really?",04/30/2014,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,average,average,poor,0,23129869,0,,poor,2,PSYC245,The teacher made the class extremely boring. Material is interesting but the teacher is terrible. His TA (Angela) grades papers very hard and is not very lenient with grades. If you are considering taking this class as an elective I would not recommend it. If you want to be an I/O Psychology major then take it for the requirement.,04/30/2014,3,3.0,,1,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He is a little big strict on the two assignments. The course material should be fun, but he made it so boring.
