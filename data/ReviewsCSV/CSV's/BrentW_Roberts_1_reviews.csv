Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24259862,0,,good,5,PSYCH350,I took Psych 250 with Roberts and loved him so much that I decided to take Personality Lab with him. He is an engaging lecturer and is really funny. His classes were two of the only classes I actually looked forward to.

N/A,average,good,average,0,19886963,0,,average,3,PSYCH250,He is extremely knowledgeable about the subject and I thought the material was very interesting. My complaint is that he claims that statistics show that review sheets don't actually help and he reinforces this belief by not offering a very thorough review sheet or review session.

Only criticism: he once gave his opinion on a debated topic and talked about it as if the other view was, well, stupid.
