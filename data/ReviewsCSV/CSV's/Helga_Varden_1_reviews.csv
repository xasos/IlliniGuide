N/A,good,good,good,0,21483645,0,,good,4,PHIL422,"Professor Varden is one of the most amazing teachers I've ever had. She is intensely passionate, but incredibly patient in explaining the material. If you're confused, she'll make the time to work out the tricky parts with you. I recommend her to anyone who isn't lazy. You'll also be a better writer if you take her comments seriously.",04/03/2013,4,4.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I was disappointed to read some of the below posted comments, but they clearly represent a failing of the student less the instructor - this professor taught me more than I ever could've imagined. Kind, cheerful, forgiving (it's a tough subject), and patient. If you want to learn it, take it with Varden.",12/28/2011,4,4.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She can be a little bit all over the place sometimes and it is hard to follow her, but if you pay attention you will learn a lot, if you aren't already familiar with Rawls and Pogge, that is.

She'll never shoot down your answer if you answer a question in class, so you never feel stupid. She's a good teacher too. She is willing to help but does that teacher thing where they make you figure it out on your own. She's awesome and hilarious though!!",10/15/2009,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Professor Varden was very unclear with what point she was trying to make, and most of the time the point was completely stupid!
