He quickly adapted his lectures to fit our needs. Although he does skip around sometimes, if you pay attentions and ask questions, you'll do fine.  He's very kind and open to questions during lecture.",04/09/2015,4,4.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
Mandatory,good,poor,good,4,24540599,9,,good,5,CHEM104,I'm not sure why everyone is complaining about Andino. I've gone to every lecture and paid attention to what he has said and I've been doing fine. If I was confused about something I could go to his office hours and he'd explain everything nicely. It's not his job to baby you through the material. This is college.,04/03/2015,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

N/A,poor,good,poor,8,24429960,4,,poor,1,CHEM104,His can't explain relevant information. During lecture he will go over one problem which will take the majority of the time. He often repeats the same simple concepts over and over. The homework and tests are nothing like what is gone over in lecture. He uses a previous prof's pre-lecture videos to teach most of the material. Do your best to avoid.,03/03/2015,5,5.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

He is always unorganized in lecture, often repeating the same basic concepts over and over, when there are a lot more difficult topics to cover. Test and quiz questions come out of nowhere, and he's a master of expectingyou to study one thing and apply another. ",03/03/2015,5,5.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,people,people

Practice on your own and in discussion is necessary.  Lot's of people complained about this course, but they likely weren't using all resources that were available.

The material is not that easy but he tries to help you understand the best he can. He's not the greatest at answering questions, but overall a pretty decent teacher.
