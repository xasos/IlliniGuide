People usually don't do as well for the first exam, then you do better for the next two because you get use to the way he asks questions. Go to lecture, take notes on everything he talks about. Understand the concepts. Memorize some concepts/list. Difficult class but learned a lot!",05/11/2016,4,4.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Your grade comes primarily from tests, but there are in-class activities and weekly quizzes as well (of which he drops the lowest 2). The tests are a little tough, but manageable. Plus he usually does some kind of curve at the end of the semester.",04/18/2016,3,3.0,,3,N/A,3.5,3.5,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,B,,people,people

His tests are tough, and he tends to use fictitious scenarios in his exams to test your understanding of topics.

I recommend going to class, as you receive extra credit each time you participate. Exams are tough and there's a lot of content covered, but he doesn't try to trick you.
