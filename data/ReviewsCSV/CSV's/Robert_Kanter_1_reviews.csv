Not Mandatory,good,good,average,0,25380482,0,,good,4,ESE336,"Dr. Kanter is a wonderful guy, very eager to get you interested in ESE topics. The writing is not tough, although you have to work for it to get an A. Went to his office hours a couple times, and was not really interested in helping. Great class though, learned a lot and he was engaging.",11/10/2015,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,people,people

N/A,good,poor,good,0,24141483,0,,good,4,ESE497,This class was a PassFail 1 credit hour class which had a field trip and a 350 word paper afterword. Throughout the whole trip Rob was great fun to hang out with. He knew a lot about the plants and animals on the trip so it was interesting to learn from him. Class isn't mandatory so I would skip everything except the field trip.,12/19/2014,1,1.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
