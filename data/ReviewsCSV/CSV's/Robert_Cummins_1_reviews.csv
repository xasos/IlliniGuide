Why is a Philosophy teacher teaching a 300 level psych class&#63; He has no idea what he's talking about, rambles, and is extremely unclear. Can't answer simple questions, let alone teach.He's also a JERK: I joined the class late, and asked to make up the attendance points, he said no, it wasn't his fault I joined late.

Material you learn is largely useless unless you want to want to become a philosopher (hilarious).  Most of the answers to the essay questions can be found online.
