If you are an individual who is grounded in logic and reality, there is a slim chance that you will actually get anything out of this class. His 80 min classes are 60 min of fussing about, 20 minutes of confusing, stream-of-conscious lecture. Great man, Bad teacher.",03/12/2013,2,2.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
