Not Mandatory,good,average,good,2,24330449,1,,good,5,CHEM102,"Well organized course. Very test heavy, I believe that three quarters of the points come from the tests. The first two exams are pretty straightforward; not easy, but if you know your stuff you should be fine. Third exam is much more difficult, class average was a shade over 50%. Final isn't too bad. Pretty good professor for gen chem, I'd say. ",01/25/2015,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,person,people
