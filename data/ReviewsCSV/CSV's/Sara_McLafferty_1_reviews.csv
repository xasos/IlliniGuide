Her grading components are well distributed and provoke your thoughts and help you actually learn and critique what you are reading.

She asks many elementary questions during the lecture that make you feel dumb sitting there because the questions are not worth asking. The lectures are easy but the tests are challenging. Show up to lecture; she takes pop attendance and also the powerpoints are incomplete,12/26/2010,3,3.0,,3,Meh,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,18025476,0,,good,4,HIST104,McLafferty is very kind and helpful. She truly loves her subject and tries to make it interesting. Tests are half writing and half multiple choice. Since there is no book for the course you have to pay extra attention in lecture. As a result the tests can be tricky if you did not take good notes.

There's one homework assignment every week, which gets replaced by a big project at the end of the semester. Exams are tricky, but doable if you pay attention in class.
