N/A,average,good,poor,0,17602944,0,,poor,2,LIS507L,"This class makes me feel dumb, and I have a 3.94/4.00 GPA. She doesn't teach, just expects you to be able to plug in to her world. Totally incomprehensible, and the assignments make no sense. I've never been this lost in a class-and I was looking forward to cataloging.

N/A,poor,good,poor,0,13480738,0,,poor,1,LIS507,"Worst. Professor. Ever.  She refuses to teach in a linear fashion, so it is impossible to build upon what you are supposed to be learning.  Assigns homework to be completed before she has taught how to do the work.  She creates everything to hear ease and yet won't address the students needs.  Do not take this prof.",09/18/2007,5,5.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,10929666,0,,poor,1,LIS507,"Routinely refuses to teach until the last 20 minutes of class so she does not have to deal with questions.  Makes incessant excuses (e.g. laundry, cat surgeries) why grading isn't completed, but is inflexible when students ask for extensions.  Students have no idea how to complete assignments.  Strongly suggest another cataloging professor.",11/16/2005,4,4.0,,1,It's my life,1,1.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
