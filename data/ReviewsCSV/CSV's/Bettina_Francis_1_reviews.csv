A 95% on the midterm and 97% on the midterm with a B+ on the term paper (worth 20/20/30% respectively) were negated by the fact that she only graded one of our &quot;Written Homework&quot; assignments.

She babbles on and on about God knows what that has nothing to do with the topic and when she finally gets around to teaching she gets all her facts wrong.
