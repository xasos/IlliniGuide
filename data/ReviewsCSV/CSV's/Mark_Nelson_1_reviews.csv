As long as you study, you'll get the grade you deserve but you have to know your stuff! Your grade is basically based on exams only so just make sure you do well on exams. I also like how he has a policy where you can replace 2 exam scores.",02/20/2016,4,4.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

All exams are based off lecture slides so if you don't do well, it's really because you didn't study enough. Exam questions are recycled over the semesters, so you might see questions in the exam that are the same as the questions on the practice exams! easy class",12/06/2015,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

This is not something you can go over a day or two before the test you need to take. Luckily, there is a take 6 tests drop 2 policy in place in case you bomb a test.

You do get best out of 6 exams top 4 scores of exams 1,2, &5 and from exams 3,4 &6. Exams 5/6 are the optional final if you want to increase your grade to make up for it.

There are I-clickers which used to help out students by giving them 30 bonus points now they were mandatory/attendance.  He goes off powerpoints and reuses old exams.
