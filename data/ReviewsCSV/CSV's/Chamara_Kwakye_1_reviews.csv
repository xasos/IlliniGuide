N/A,good,average,good,0,18134566,0,,good,5,AFRO103,This class is super interesting and Chamara is very nice and helpful. The articles are online and you barely read them so don't spend the $60 on the course packet. She made this class one of my favorites. Grade is made up of one paper(super easy) and a couple of online quizzes. Interesting class and easy A.,01/13/2011,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,18039930,0,,good,4,EPS202,Chamara is the TA to take if you're taking EPS 202. She is unbelievably helpful when it comes to tests... Trust me... She also speaks to students as adults and os not afraid to swear in class; it really lightens the mood of an otherwise boring class. She is on her students' side when it comes to just about everything. Great TA.,12/24/2010,1,1.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
