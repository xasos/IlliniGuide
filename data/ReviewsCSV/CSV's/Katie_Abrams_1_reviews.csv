N/A,poor,good,poor,0,21553323,0,,poor,1,AGCM320,This was by far the worst professor and experience in class I have ever had. She never has anything organized. Gives us more work to do on a huge project which she doesnt explain well and confuses students because they are not trained for everything she wants. Avoid this person at all costs. I questioned UIUC's ability to choose quality professors.,04/17/2013,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She challenges her students with real world assignments and shows you what life will be like in an advertising/communications career. If you are a hard worker and really want to learn something, THIS IS IT!",01/03/2013,4,4.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
