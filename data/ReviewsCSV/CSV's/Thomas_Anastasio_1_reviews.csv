There are 14 quizzes worth 20 points each, but he drops the 4 lowest ones, making this class an easy A.

Society and the Brain is an excellent elective; I'm an accounting major and I had no trouble at all understanding the material - so don't be intimidated.,01/08/2012,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
