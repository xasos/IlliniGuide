Some other ECE professors always tend to trick you and make the exam impossible, however, Prof. Sarwate just wants you to learn. So he makes his hwks helpful and exam just for you to get an easy A. I suggest take his class, the professor himself is the nicest person I've ever met in U of I",05/12/2011,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Given that his class is &quot;optional&quot; due to the online slides, he will try to make sure all his students understand the material he teaches. The exams and its grading are another story. The grading is quite harsh (very little partial credit opportunities) and some exams are very hard.",01/06/2010,4,4.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
