Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25760461,0,,good,5,IE400,"Really amazing professor who's willing to spend the time required to explain complicated topics. Gives a lot of homework, but after you pick up how to use SAS, the homework becomes really enjoyable. The focus of the class is not on how to solve problems, but how to interpret your solutions and how to use them in real life. Was a great help to me.",12/18/2015,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,24787977,0,,good,4,IE400,"She is very patient and helpful. I was struggling early on in her class and she did little things to help me out until I felt caught up. She got to know every student and built a rapport with everyone. Receptive to questions, changing lectures to student needs, etc. Required SAS for homework but sometimes didn't explain how to use it very well.
