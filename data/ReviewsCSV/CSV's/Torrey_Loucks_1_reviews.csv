Not Mandatory,good,average,average,0,26120756,0,,good,4,SHS300,He was better than a lot of other professors. He is actually sometimes funny and his lectures make sense.

He is so scattered during lecture and when you go into office hours for help, he will confuse you even more. His powerpoints do not match up with the textbook and a lot of the slides are inaccurate. His tests are extremely tough but he does offer extra credit ",11/03/2015,5,5.0,,2,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,person,people

Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,23319404,0,,good,4,SHS300,"Very work intensive but that's to be expected in an anatomy course. He was very knowledgeable about the topic, had a dry sense of humor which might be taken the wrong way if your personality differed. Helpful if the students appeared engaged in the course and put effort into it. He was very objective, not a teacher who would coddle you.",05/27/2014,5,5.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Wasn't meant to teach this course, but after having him for SHS300 I feel future students should be warned about his poor teaching style. Information given in lecture isn't clear and test questions don't reflect what is learned Seems more interested in research than teaching Don't recommend his classes",08/01/2012,3,3.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
