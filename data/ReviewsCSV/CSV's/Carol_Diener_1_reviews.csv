Her 340 is totally unrealistic and will consume upwards of 18 hours out of your week.  Imposes all sorts of **** protocol to make your life hell/feel important about herself.  TA is a frigid Canadian **** too.  BEWARE.,04/16/2005,2,2.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
