Not Mandatory,good,average,good,1,23544406,0,,good,5,ENGL280,"Dale is absolutely wonderful. She's engaging and energetic and genuinely cares about her students' success. My recommendations for succeeding in her class: be ready for the challenge, participate in discussions, and go to her office hours even if you don't really need help. I can't say enough about how great her classes are.",08/20/2014,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,person
