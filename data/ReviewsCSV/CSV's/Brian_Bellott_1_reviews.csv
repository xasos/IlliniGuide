He is always there when you need help and he always has a review session before each quiz and test which I thought really helped.  He can be sarcastic at times, but that just adds to the class.",11/16/2005,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He was and still is one of those rare TAs that actually care about his students and set up help sessions.
