Many of us know how quantum physics can be too abstract at times, his lecture notes make it very intuitive by explaining concepts through analogies from classical physics ( which is way more intuitive). Take the man's class and you'll be gucci with ur grades/quantum physics knowlege. The guy is a G.",02/15/2016,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
