N/A,average,good,average,0,15800448,0,,average,3,ADV300,Pretty much a sour apple. She would appear nice at first but then her mean side came out. She lectured the class like 3 times about manners. 4 exams and 1 optional final is too much. Exams aren't that difficult if you actually study but pretty much she's a more demanding 300 teacher than the ADV 300 past professors that I heard about.,05/09/2009,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Lectures are necessary because her powerpoint help, but you need to know beyond that. She doesn't give you much informtion about the test questions either.
