There's no point in going to lectures; I only went to three and rarely saw more than ten other people present. Luckily, this class was generously curved at the end (by a bit less than 10%, I think).

Okay his tests are easy enough but he does not explain his lecture slides at all and just flies through them, and it sounds like he is just talking to himself for the whole lecture. The material is easy enough to understand except when he goes on about coupling and NMR spectra",04/07/2011,1,1.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
