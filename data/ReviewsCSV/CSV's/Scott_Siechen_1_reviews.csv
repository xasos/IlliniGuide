After having a lousy time in 250, I was starting to hate my major, but Siechen made MCB more interesting. He struggles to explain things sometimes, and he does make some mistakes, but I think he knows what he's talking about. He's fairly new to teaching. Very passionate and personable!",07/09/2008,2,2.0,,5,Meh,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

His tests are sort of hard, and you'll definitely have a head ache when you get out from all the reading you have to do, but it's worth it to have him for a teacher!",02/21/2008,5,5.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He gives incomplete notes so you have to go to lecture to fill them out but I liked that because you knew the stuff you wrote is the stuff you needed to know,10/20/2007,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,average,poor,0,12789593,0,,poor,1,MCB252,Totally arrogant. Had Prof. Bellini in lecture once and pointed out several mistakes Siechen made during lecture. And this was only one lecture. He seemed very confident and arrogant all the time even though he was most likely making mistakes along the way. Ridiculous&lt;&lt;graded!!&gt;&gt; clicker questions as well in which he could barely explain himself.,01/18/2007,3,3.0,,2,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
