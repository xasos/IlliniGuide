He's a fantastic professor for whom I can give nothing but the highest praise. His lectures are clear and interesting to even the most disinterested of students and his booming voice will keep you alert even at 8am.

Office hours were very helpful and sometimes necessary to complete homework. Only bad thing is he talks REALLY loud.
