Mandatory,good,average,good,6,23260089,0,,good,5,BADM378,One of my favorite professors at UIUC. Class is case based so make sure you pick a good group because you work with them at least once a week and its a lot of the course points. Keeps the lectures interesting and always tries to make jokes. If you like math take LIM for 378 if not and you like case studies and analyzing them then take this class.,05/15/2014,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people
