Her PowerPoint slides are VERY unclear, so you have to go to class. Her tests are super nitpicky, requiring that you know precise details. They are also unpredictable and challenging, making it feel like a 300/400 level course.",05/17/2014,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,23115708,0,,good,5,PSYC220,I didn't realize this course was super interesting until I had my third class. Then I started to ask questions and really felt engaged into it. It's so helpful to build up the psychology-wise critical thinking ability. Prof. Beck is so nice that she answered questions after every single class. And you don't need to buy a textbook at all!!!!!,04/28/2014,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
