While it was one of my trickier classes, it was the only class I loved to attend. Lectures are riddled with jokes and demonstrations. The difficult and abstract subject matter is make quite simple.

N/A,good,good,good,0,14238988,0,,good,5,CS125,I loved it when he took the floor. He is so charismatic and can make hard concepts seem simple. He can really get you motivated about computer science and relates all the things you'll learn in his class to upper level courses. He also brings in guest speakers. The projects you do are challenging but practical. He's one of the best.,04/03/2008,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
