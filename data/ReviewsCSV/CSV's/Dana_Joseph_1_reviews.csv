The subject matter is incredibly straight forward, as is she, and she gives students every opportunity to do well. Skimming the book helps for pop quizzes, and the written assignments are no big deal.",12/20/2010,1,1.0,,5,Meh,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

We had pop quizzes, but you could pretty much figure out when they were going to be. The midterm and final are purely lecture based. There is no need to read, except for the pop quizzes. There are two papers, a one page paper and a two to four page paper easy",11/14/2010,1,1.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
