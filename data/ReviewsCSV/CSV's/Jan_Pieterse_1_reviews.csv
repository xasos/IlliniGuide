He has a lot of humour and while his lectures are sometimes hard to follow, he will gladly answer all your questions. If you do your homework regularly, the tests are not hard. Also, the TA is the most adorable man ever.",12/03/2013,2,2.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,18305465,0,,poor,1,GLOBL120,He came and taught at UCSB.  Worst professor I've ever had.  Every lecture was a rant about how the US sucked and Marxism was the way to go.  No facts.  Just his terribly-accented opinion.  Tests were impossible to decipher as well.  Avoid him at all costs.,03/23/2011,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I could not understand two consecutive words that came out of his mouth, and was uninterested the entire quarter. Horrible organization and terrible lecturing.",11/30/2009,2,2.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He is challenging, though, and abstract at times-- if you are looking for an easy, blow-off course (as many in my class were), you might try looking elsewhere.  He is extremely helpful but doing well will require real thought and work on your part.",01/15/2008,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
