Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,26240802,0,,poor,1,ENGL245,"Unimaginably horrendous professor. Refuses any feedback, is sarcastic, lazy, unprepared, and boring. I got an A in the class so I'm not just salty.   The tests were based on spelling out the foreign authors last names. Everyday in class while we were waiting for her to get there late, the entire class would roast her.  Do not take this class.",04/06/2016,4,4.0,,1,N/A,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
