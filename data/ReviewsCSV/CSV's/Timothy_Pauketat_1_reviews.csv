It wouldn't have been the same without him. He's an endless fountain of knowledge about archaeology and was attentive to his students. If you're interested in field school, North American archaeology, or archaeology in general, he's the best.",04/12/2013,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

However, he does miss class a lot and you can tell teaching is not his favorite thing but he is always interested in student opinion and tries to help out as much as he can.

The exams are very detailed, and not only do you have to go to lecture, but you gotta pay attention pretty closely and he gives pop quizzes that do impact your grade.
