Not Mandatory,poor,average,poor,0,26401354,0,,poor,1,CS421,"One of the worst professors at UIUC. He comes to a 50 minutes class 10-15 minutes late. Mostly tries to read slides, but even that not correctly, he mumbles, makes mistakes, does not correct himself. It's a mystery to me how he conducts research.",04/28/2016,3,3.0,,1,N/A,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

MPs are poorly designed and often contain mistakes. Although the final grade cutoff was pretty generous, it's not an enjoyable class and you don't really learn much.",05/27/2015,4,4.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

The MPs were *terrible*, although I believe that one of the TAs (Minas) was in charge of those. TONS of revisions and extensions due to bugs, and an incredible amount of confusion and anger on piazza.",05/17/2015,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,6,24740408,0,,poor,1,CS421,"MP's were scarcely debugged before release, prompting multiple confusing changes. MP's are generally brutal and have little connection to the lectures, which lack student interaction and are taught quite badly. Office hours aren't too helpful and tests are too long for the average student to finish.
