I did not pay attention in his class and stopped going after the second week, yet I managed to pull nearly 100 on both tests and did not even take the third one.

There is a lot of homework but its a GREAT alternative to ECon 202 & 203 (by far one of the hardest classes in here).However, he curves the tests, drops the lowest one and gave option to redo questions on 1 test if wanted! :)",12/06/2012,3,3.0,,5,Meh,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Its a great alternative to the Econ 202/203 because getting a good grade is very possible. The classes are just really boring and reading the book is probably a good idea.",11/08/2011,4,4.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
