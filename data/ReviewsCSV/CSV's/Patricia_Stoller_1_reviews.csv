Mandatory,good,average,good,0,22600663,0,,good,5,CPSC112,"You may love or hate her attitude and mannerisms, but she teaches the class well. Lots of work but none of it is too hard (typically for 100-level) and the joking can be cringe worthy but is at least better than monotone slide reading.",12/18/2013,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She isn't afraid to speak her mind, so class is often HILARIOUS. It was a pretty easy class and she definitely helps out when you need it.",09/26/2013,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Yes, she is strict with rules and expectations (which are not unreasonable), but I appreciate her following through with what she says. College students are old enough to be able to respect that without complaint.  Her quizzes/exams are not easy, but certainly not extremely difficult.",01/16/2013,4,4.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,20003125,0,,poor,1,CPSC112,I didn't like her at all. She would take points off for using a laptop or a phone in class. I just thought that's ridiculous. All she did is just reading off her powerpoint slides which I can do by myself at home. She didn't make the ppt slides available online. Her lectures were always boring. I would never take this class again.,04/05/2012,5,5.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,17351172,0,,good,4,CPSC112,Often unpleasantly awkward to sit in her classes because her jokes are never funny and just seem to entertain herself.  You will learn a ton in this class if you do everything yourself and dont copy.  The class setup will make you work but it is flawless in terms of covering the material.  She does have some obscure test questions once in a while.,06/20/2010,3,3.0,,5,Meh,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
