Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,26041815,0,,good,5,GCL137,"This was the coolest class ever! You make your own movies, which is so much easier than it looks. Class discussion was really fun and inspiring. I feel like I learned so much that I didn't even know I needed to learn. Also, the class was small, so we all got to know each other really well. If you can take this class, do it!!",02/09/2016,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

She attempts to be eloquent but ends up confusing everyone. She likes to hear herself talk. She posts study guides 3 days before the exam expecting all students to do well on an exam that she scheduled on Reading Day.",05/07/2012,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
