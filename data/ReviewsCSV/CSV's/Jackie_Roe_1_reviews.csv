I mean, I didn't mind getting just a B in the class cause I was around her the whole time. And she's smart as hell, and that makes her hotter. Her grading was average for a teacher.... Not all students can get As. But it doesnt matter. Cause she is hot.",10/18/2006,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,average,poor,0,12067369,0,,poor,2,SPCM112,She is very disrespectful to students she doesn't like.  She is never in her office during her office hours and made us fill out her evaluations in HER OFFICE because she was so far behind on grading!  As if any students would feel free to say what they really think of her when she could look at your comments as soon as you walk out the door!!!,07/10/2006,3,3.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
