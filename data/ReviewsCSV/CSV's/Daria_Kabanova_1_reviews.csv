She's very easy to contact and get ahold of and she's willing to help you if you need it. The only thing is that for a third year Russian class, I wish it were more immersion based. I think more would get done that way. Exams are reasonable.",12/28/2006,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
