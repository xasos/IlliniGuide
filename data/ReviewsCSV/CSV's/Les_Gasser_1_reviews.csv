N/A,average,good,average,0,25861551,0,,average,3,INFO202,"Really rough class for the INFO minor. The twice weekly reading summaries were way too long and often really outdated. The lectures are pretty hard to pay attention in because they are dull, and notes are provided by him after class. BUT, you need to attend to turn in summaries. A is doable, but lots of unnecessary work. TA was tough grader too.",01/02/2016,5,5.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,25504407,1,,good,4,INFO202,This is a solid class taught by a solid teacher. A very easy A with some interesting material. The reading summaries due every class are kind of annoying but it's really easy to write them once you get in the swing of things and all the readings are less than 30 pages which is reasonable. Lectures are also usually pretty cool but sometimes dull.,11/30/2015,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,person,people

I fell asleep in lecture multiple times because he was so boring. He did make an effort to improve over the semester in terms of engaging the class.

The professor is really chill, summaries are easy to do, 2 papers, and final are also very easy! No midterm, just a mock final that isn't even graded. Easy as long as you put in some effort.

Not only are you forced to go to the boring lecture by turning in reading summaries every darn class, the papers are graded harshly, the TA's are absolutely useless and he changed the format of the final because people might ""guess the right answer on accident.""
