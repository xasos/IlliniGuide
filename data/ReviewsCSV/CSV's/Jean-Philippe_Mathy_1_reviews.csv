Going in I didn't know what to expect going in but was pleasantly surprised. You can tell Professor Mathy loves the material and his enthusiasm is infectious.,06/13/2015,4,4.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

The class focuses on the modernization of Paris and you read three books/write papers on them. It is extremely boring. The professor doesn't help with any questions, he directs you to the TAs which don't really help either.",05/23/2014,3,3.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

In fact, I'm typing this out during lecture.  The course description is so misleading - never have I been in a class so boring.",11/28/2011,3,3.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

There was a LOT of reading. Like I said though, if it's something you are interested in, I'm sure you could gain a lot from this class, there are just better adv. comp. classes",03/24/2010,3,3.0,,3,Low,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
