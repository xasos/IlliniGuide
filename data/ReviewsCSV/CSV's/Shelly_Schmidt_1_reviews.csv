N/A,average,average,average,0,23656786,0,,average,2,FSHN101,Not as easy as I thought it would be- you can't skip class and must be actively paying attention bc some of the material is hard and she expects you to a already know a lot of chemistry. If you have an A before the final you don't have to take it which is nice. Lecture is pretty boring even though she tries to make jokes a lot. ,10/15/2014,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
