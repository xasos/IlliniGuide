The homework is painfully easy, and I got a B on the midterm without studying at all. Attending class is crucial because you're graded on participation. Great teacher, she's funny too.",11/14/2010,2,2.0,,5,Meh,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I recommend going to class because you are graded more on how you speak Spanish rather than write. Also, homework is very easy.  It's online, and you can do it whenever you have time.  It's a great review class, and I'm getting an A.",10/27/2009,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
