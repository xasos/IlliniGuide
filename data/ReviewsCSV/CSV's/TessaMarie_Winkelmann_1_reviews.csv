Had a couple in-class essays which was basically regurgitating the discussion we have directly beforehand. Final project was SO easy, work split between 3-4 people. No exams/finals/papers.

All quizzes open book, essays are talked about beforehand, final project was a 5 minute maximum podcast on a chosen country (easy). I really enjoyed this class!",12/13/2013,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
