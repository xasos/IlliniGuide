N/A,average,good,average,0,15260044,0,,average,3,CHEM102,very nice teacher who really knows her subject. sometiems hard to learn from her. fell asleep in lecture a few times. some of the lectures were confusing so be prepared with the power point slides before class for taking notes. stay on top of your work. this is not a class you can get behind in cuz its really hard to catch up on,12/21/2008,4,4.0,,2,Low,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

At the end of the semester the chem department curves every class's grades so that each teacher's class has roughly the same grades. There is a reason why before the curve her class had the lowest scores.

You'll really have to pull your weight. Print off or read the PP slides prior to attending class. She uses them heavily and will assume that you printed them. Some days she's unclear.
