She's rude and argues with you if you ask her if you understood correctly. She is not organized with her lectures, but barely ties it together at the end. She knows her stuff, but I honestly wish I never took her class.",06/16/2008,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
