N/A,good,poor,good,0,18573544,0,,good,5,EPS201,Erin's the best. If you take the class make sure she's your TA...you'll thank me later. She really makes a class that is vehemently boring otherwise very engaging because she's so passionate about what she does.,05/10/2011,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The critical thinking skills which I developed in her class and under her wing prove that her teaching style is EXTREMELY effective and made this course more insightful than I could ever have predicted.

N/A,good,average,good,0,17537908,0,,good,5,EPS201,Erin's definitely one of the best teachers I've had in my education. She did demand a lot from us but her demands helped us learn so much more and maintain that knowledge. She took the time to get to know us and that is what made her a fantastic teacher.
