N/A,good,poor,good,0,13114249,0,,good,5,FIN451,"Excellent teacher and is very helpful. Listens to his students and can sense when his students do not understand. Exams (3)are easy and the final is not cummulative. Attendence and particiaption is required (5%). Final project is 30% of the grade, and requires some work and class presentation. Very well-dressed, has excellent taste in ties.",05/05/2007,1,1.0,,5,Meh,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
