N/A,average,good,average,0,12731820,0,,average,3,PS243,The class was a lot of work and it seemed like she knew what she was talking about but never quite showed it. She used lecture outlines and basically talked right off of them. I did learn a lot but mostly from discussion. Be prepared to do a lot of work and gain little from it. She can also be hard to get a hold of if you need her.,01/06/2007,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,3,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Tests are multiple choice and true/false, a little difficult.  Have a lot of outside work.  Have to see 3 movies at the library, and write a report on them. Have to do weekly abstracts of the past week's material.  But all worth while.",01/15/2006,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
