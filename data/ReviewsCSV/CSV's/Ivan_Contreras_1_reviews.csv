Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,26553710,0,,good,5,MATH416,Greatest teacher I have ever had in college so far. Very nice person and love to answer your question.  Explanation is clear and helps you how to think about the problems. Office hours always help. I guess the only problem is sometimes he would be really late to office hour.

He often asks students about how to think this question instead of just give you the answer, which help us think a lot during lectures.
