N/A,good,average,good,0,23802676,0,,good,5,CWL242,"Robert Rushing is a fantastic professor. He often lectures in a 3-piece suit and is easily the most attractive professor I've had. In addition, he's a great speaker and his lectures are always interesting and engaging. He focuses a lot on the popular cultural influence of the books. Lots of reading and writing, but that's expected in a lit class.",11/12/2014,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Prof. Rushing gives a great overview of cultural movements and relates them to modern day using movies like Fight Club and Bridget Jones' Diary.

He has an easy-going way about him that shows his confidence in what he is teaching, but he is also very pleasant. He's a great professor, but he wouldn't let me take the make-up when there was already one planned, but I didnt' have an official reason. He runs a good course.",10/08/2007,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He talks kind of quickly though, so your note-taking skills have to be good, and he also assigns a lot of reading. However, his teaching style is wonderful and his class was one of my favorites.",05/15/2006,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
