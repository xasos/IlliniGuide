Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,26681611,0,,good,5,MATH285,"Great professor, but I feel like there were too many review classes where we just went over previous material. Gives handouts, and tells you what to expect on midterms/final. Watch out though, as the final is worth 40% of the grade",06/01/2016,2,2.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,26292968,0,,good,4,MATH285,He gives handouts every lecture. You will want those handouts if you don't want to read the book. He will give you extra credit problems every quiz or exam.  Quizzes and exams are relatively easy comparing to other sections. And he usually will review topics covered in tests in the previous lecture. So show up!,04/13/2016,2,2.0,,4,N/A,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people
Not Mandatory,good,average,good,8,25199288,0,,good,5,MATH286,"Prof. Xiao gives really great, clear-cut lectures. He frequently asks if we understand what he just derived, and he actually looks at the class to see if anyone raises their hand. He assigns only enough homework to cover each type of diff. eq. we learn (4-8 problems a week). Overall a great professor.",09/20/2015,2,2.0,,5,Low,5,5.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
