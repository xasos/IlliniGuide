Mandatory,poor,good,poor,1,23076406,1,,poor,1,CMN101,Easily the Most Useless professor on campus. Grades the class unfairly and has no interest in student efforts or opinions except his own.

N/A,poor,average,poor,1,20467084,0,,poor,1,CMN112,He was the worst instructor I have ever had at the University of Illinois. He tries to indoctrinate the class with his annoying liberal views (I wouldn't care except it's completely irrelevant to a public speaking class).

I enjoy the class but his recitations sometimes feel like they drag on forever. He also comes off as creepy sometimes. I think he knows the material well but it's hard to relate to a guy that seems so obsessed with himself. Take this class but with a different TA section!",10/05/2011,2,2.0,,2,It's my life,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
