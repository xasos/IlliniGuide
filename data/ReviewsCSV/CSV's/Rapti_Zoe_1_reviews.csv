Alot of students have trouble with her lectures becuase she is a small international woman with a soft voice so try to sit close. Teaches fairly tough with algebra you may not be familiar with, so that causes confusion. However, her main positive is that she wants you to learn it and she is willing to help anytime you need it. &quot;Haa-low&quot;",10/26/2005,3,3.0,,4,It's my life,3,3.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
