Robin will choose who she likes and those people will succeed. Sucking up in this class will go a long way. For papers, the whole theory that she tells us to grade on is longer is better. Content is secondary. Finally, much of the art history she teaches is wrong.",07/31/2013,1,1.0,,4,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

There was one research paper on a 20th century artist, 3 reflection papers on artworks. However, if you want do do some art and put more emphasis on that than just a paper, don't take this class.
