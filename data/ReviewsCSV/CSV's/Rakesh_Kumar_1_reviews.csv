N/A,average,good,average,0,24857696,0,,good,3,411,This guys is a genius.  I had him for ECE 411 and ECE 190.  He was knew when teaching 190 so he was terrible at it (made many mistakes) but you can tell he is extremely intelligent.  Try to take him in more advanced classes like 411 where you can learn from him.  If you are actually interested in CompE you'll want to be in his lectures.,05/18/2015,4,4.0,,4,It's my life,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

He took a class that could very easily have been horrendously boring and made it fun and interesting, and really sparked my interest in the subject.  He writes tough tests, and 411 is NOT an easy class. But really fun overall.",05/09/2015,4,4.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person
N/A,good,average,good,1,20308272,0,,good,4,ECE411,He teaches slowly and with a lot of examples. His research area is in low power processors and he talks about it a fair bit. Always good to know real world stuff. About 50-55 really bright Comp E students take this senior design class and despite doing above average on all exams and 100% on MP's I couldn't manage a A so was a bit disappointed.,05/18/2012,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

I understood what he was saying most of the time so I guess I was lucky, T/As are helpful though so it wasn't a wash for all those who didn't attend lecture.",05/14/2009,3,3.0,,2,Really into it,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,15293343,0,,poor,2,ECE511,"Professor Kumar &quot;led&quot; this class like a discussion section.  This course should introduce some advanced concepts, which he failed to cover.  He assumed that students already knew the material. Instead of teaching the material, he depended on students to discuss it; hardly a proper environment for learning new concepts.  He also lacked organization.",12/29/2008,4,4.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

On a side note - The textbook for the course is kind of useless, I recommend getting Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach instead.",05/08/2008,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
