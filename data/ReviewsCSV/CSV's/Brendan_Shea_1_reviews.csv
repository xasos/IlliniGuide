Quizzes were a bit too intense for a intro 120 class though. The grading criteria, writing amount, and his expectations are easily obtainable if you attend class; not hard. Professor Shea cares about his students and is always open for office hours. Take him",12/16/2012,2,2.0,,5,Meh,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The writing amount is ridiculous for not being an advanced comp. Not interesting enough, i thought it would be more debating. Grading standard not clear and it seemed like complete opinion. Went in for help wasn't very helpful.Ridiculous",05/13/2009,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
