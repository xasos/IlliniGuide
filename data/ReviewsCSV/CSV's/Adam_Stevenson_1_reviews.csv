N/A,good,average,good,0,13661534,0,,good,5,ECON102,"Adam is a fantastic TA, and will make for a great econ professor when that old bag Gottheil finally retires.  He is the only reason I am doing well in the class..if you don't get him I would drop the class because you probably will get a foreign TA instead.  I highly recommend Adam.",11/15/2007,2,2.0,,5,Low,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,12178929,0,,good,4,ECON303,A TA who taught intermediate macro over the summer (his first time teaching the class).  He did a nice job.  He's very into econ which is great and is pretty fun.  Class wasn't too hard.  My only complaint is that he gives you a LOT of information (which is good) - but it's hard to know what you're supposed to take away and know for tests.,08/22/2006,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
