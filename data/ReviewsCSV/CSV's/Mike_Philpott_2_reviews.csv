N/A,good,poor,good,0,13365956,0,,good,5,ME170,"This class was pretty interesting as a whole. The 8am lectures with Philpott were a little boring to say the least, but he realized it was boring too, so he cancelled a lot. You should probably just stay in bed. The final presentation was pretty fun, and watching him react to what some people presented was hilarious, especially if they were stupid.",07/30/2007,1,1.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

It's a pity his class is at 8:00am -- I would have preferred to be awake for his lectures, since they were on-point and told you what you needed to know.",06/05/2007,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,13017792,0,,good,4,ME170,Philpott is a very good teacher for the ME 170 course. He really knows his material and is very helpful. He tries to put a lot of necessary material in the lectures which are difficult at 8 am. Throws pop quizes once in a while. Important to go to lectures. They will pay off in the long run.,04/16/2007,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
