Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,22330656,0,,good,4,GEOG110,"VERY NICE professor; as a veteran dispatched to Kosovo she talks about the Balkans a lot, but very helpful to answering questions. The class is interesting but no guarantees you won't doze off at times. All quizzes and one exam (the  final) are online, easy class if you either go to lecture or read the book (don't have to do both). Great class!",11/16/2013,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
