N/A,good,poor,good,0,21826091,0,,good,5,MATH4281,I took her class at U of M. Her lectures are super clear and she posts her notes online as well. Quizzes are not that hard if you pay attention to every single lecture. Always show up at her office hour and it is extremely helpful! Her grading is very generous because she understands there are many seniors in our class.  Strongly recommend!,05/25/2013,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
