Mandatory,average,good,good,1,24615696,0,,good,3,AE454,"AE 454 might not be as fun as the other more ""hands-on"" control classes, but the understanding of Lagrangian and Hamitonian dynamics systems are very useful if you are a control engineer, and sri did a pretty decent job presenting his material. He is also patient to students and is willing to explain things in class if you ask him.",04/17/2015,5,5.0,,5,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,person

He really likes his dynamics, so sometimes he gets a little ahead of himself and is hard to follow. Office hours with TAs were really helpful, tests weren't too bad if you understood the homework.

But once you come out of his course, you would have learnt a lot about Dynamics. This is definitely one of those classes where the grade should not be a factor while looking back at what you have learnt.",03/08/2010,4,4.0,,4,Low,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,person
