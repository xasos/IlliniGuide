N/A,good,good,good,0,15365445,0,,good,4,SPCM275,This is not a class you can miss lecture or skim through the reading. You have to be in class AND pay attention. You have to read the book AND make connections. If you can do that then w the curve you'll do great. This class helped my GPA alot. And it was very interesting!
