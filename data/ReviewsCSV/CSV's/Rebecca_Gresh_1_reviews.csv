The class is interesting and there aren't any exams, but there are weekly online quizzes which are fairly easy. She is very considerate of our lives as students and often extends deadlines for papers if someone tells her that they need extra time.

She is truly excited about making a difference in the world, and just wants to open students' minds to the society around them. Seriously cannot recommend this professor enough.
