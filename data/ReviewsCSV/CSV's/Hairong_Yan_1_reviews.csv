Material covered on tests and quizes only checks wether you read. This class could be so much better. Terrible class for an entry level anthropology course.",05/22/2006,4,4.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

N/A,average,good,average,0,11683823,0,,poor,2,ANTH103,One of my least favorite professors I've had at U of I yet.  Assigns way too much reading.  Tests are difficult because you do not know what will be on them.  Sometimes is rude to students.  Do not take this professor for an entry level class.,04/10/2006,5,5.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
