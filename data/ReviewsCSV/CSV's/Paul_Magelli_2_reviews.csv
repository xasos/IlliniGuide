Lectures are pointless.  Read the book, lecture notes, and go to discussion.  I pulled a B in the class and didn't go to lecture after the midterm.  Tests are approximately 75% book and 25% lecture/discussion.  Get an english TA.",08/24/2005,2,2.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Tests are 70-80 MC questions, very basic entry level stuff. You do all the learning on your own. Most of the lectures don't correlate with the readings. About 15-20 of the questions are from lecture/online lecture notes.",05/24/2005,1,1.0,,4,It's my life,3,3.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
