N/A,good,average,good,0,17289264,0,,good,4,GE320,"Woz is a fantastic teacher. He will work you hard, but only because he wants his students to learn (I believe this 100%). You need to do your work, but he is good about rewarding students who have worked hard at the end of the semester.  So even if you think you're in bad shape, hang in there.
