Sometimes it can be tough to see where he's going with regard to the topic, but it's a pleasure listening to him talk. Funny, extremely nice and caring, absolutely brilliant. Full of amusement; he has a refreshing sense of humor.

And he peppers his lectures with interesting commentary, although he is liberally biased, which may be why I like him despite the class topic.  And I think he's hot.
