I emailed him a simple question that I needed clarification on and he simply told me, &quot;I said this in class&quot;. Well, I am sorry I forgot and wanted to make sure. His powerpoints are totally useless and his study guides are insane.

Lectures consist of generally around 80 powerpoint slides filled with either text or useless pictures.  Terrible lecturer also.  He gives out a study guide before the exams and if you go through that you should get a B.  Avoid class!,11/08/2009,3,3.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
