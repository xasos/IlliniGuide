Although this class's material is rather dry, he gives enthusiastic lectures and puts a lot of work into the class. He's very helpful and goes out of his way to provide feedback and react quickly to logistic issues. He also maintains the course site and welcomes feedback from students!

Although the class somewhat lacked an organized way of presenting the material, i'm sure he will improve that in no time.

N/A,average,good,average,3,24174057,0,,average,2,CS357,"He's a good guy and cares about his students; I'm not sure he's the best teacher for this class, though. Lecture format is weird with only notebook scribbles and Python demos to study from. Homework questions were hit or miss when  it came to their  relevance to the coursework. Tests were usually brutal and depended somewhat on lucky guessing.",12/23/2014,5,5.0,,4,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
