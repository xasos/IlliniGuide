Mandatory,good,average,good,0,26219956,0,,good,4,CS465,The course resembled more of a psychology course. This is to be expected for HCI and students who do not like that should not specialize in HCI. There was one large group project with various checkpoints. Very few individual assignments. 95% of the material comes from lecture powerpoints.,04/02/2016,2,2.0,,4,N/A,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people

Mandatory,average,good,average,2,25817440,0,,poor,2,CS465,"He didn't care about the class. For exams, you have to memorize every single word of every lecture and you also have to remember examples from class. His lectures are the most boring to go to. He has no enthusiasm. Horrible at responding to emails. There are pop quizzes that you are not allowed to make up and are worth 6.7% of your grade.

All you need is to memory every single words he said(which is really boring and makes you sleepy), including the examples in class, cause that's what's gonna be tested in the exam.

The only problem is his powerpoints are not very clear outside of lecture (as in if you miss a class and just look at the powerpoint for notes)",03/06/2014,1,1.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A-,,person,people

The lectures are interesting, as well - especially those dealing with illusions and problem solving techniques. A helpful and clear professor.
