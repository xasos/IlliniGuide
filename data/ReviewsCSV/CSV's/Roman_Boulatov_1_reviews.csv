N/A,good,good,average,0,17689141,3,,good,4,CHEM203,Most people don't realize how good he is at being a professor. Just because he's not really exciting doesn't mean that he's not good. I personally really like his teaching style and wish that more prof's could be like him. He's pretty quiet but you have to realize that he does know what he's talking about and his class is fair (its bell curved).,10/25/2010,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
