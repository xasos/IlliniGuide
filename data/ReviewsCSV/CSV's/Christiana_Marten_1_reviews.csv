Not every day you have a world famous artist teaching you how to sculpt cardboard. She pushed me to do better, and that is why my project turned out so well.

She's the cutest teacher I've ever had and really pushes you to do your best. Sometimes she was not very clear with assignments, but if you just ask her questions about it she will spend time thorougly explaining the project.

She wasn't always the most clear when she wanted me to adapt my design, but I know that she was impressed with my dedication and the scale of my project.
