On the last day of class he was not able to explain in less than ten minutes where his office is so that we can turn in the final.  Keep in mind that he was using chalk and a blackboard as well.

Regardless, he is clearly a kind, brilliant old (and odd) man, and a mind with any versatility would be well-served by taking one of his upper level courses (101 kids should have a playpen for lambasting those who spurn their illiteracy).",04/14/2007,4,4.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
