N/A,good,average,good,0,20704528,0,,good,5,RHET105,Mark has been one of my favorite teachers that I've had in this university. As long as you skim the readings you should be good enough to participate a bit in class. He also is extremely helpful if you attend his office hours and he genuinely wants you to get a good grade. Definitely a friendly and chill guy. Loved having him as a teacher!,10/15/2012,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

It is hard to get an A on an essay; the class is sometimes very boring since its 4 essays that make up 80% of the grade. He gives quizes!! other teachers dont!
