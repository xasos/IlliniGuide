N/A,good,good,average,0,17278858,0,,good,4,ECE440,"Prof. Hsieh is a pretty good professor. He knows clearly about the material. But ECE440 is just too hard, and he tries to cover more than what we need sometimes. In terms of preparing for the exams, the TA can help more. But overall he is pretty good, at least better than other ECE440 lecturers.",05/28/2010,5,5.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He makes the ece440 material easy to understand, its very caring to students, and cares more about the student than the grade.  I wish he taught more classes! Go to his lectures, they help, and if not, go to his office hours, even better",12/13/2008,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
