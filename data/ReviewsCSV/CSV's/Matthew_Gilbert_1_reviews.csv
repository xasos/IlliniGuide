N/A,poor,good,poor,5,24399237,0,,poor,1,ECE340,"I took this class before Gilbert ruined it. His lectures slides are incorrect, he egregiously misses class , poor grasp of the material. Throws around words like 'POST CMOS' to impress people. He portrays himself as a physicist to engineers and vice versa; the truth is that he is neither. A waste of taxpayer money.",02/20/2015,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Not Mandatory,average,good,poor,2,23131114,0,,poor,2,ECE340,"Definitely not a professor you would want to have if you expect to learn or have the material introduced in class. He expects that you have read and understood the material before class. In class, he just rambles on to himself on equation derivations and supplementary information regarding the material based on his own knowledge (not the book).",04/30/2014,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
