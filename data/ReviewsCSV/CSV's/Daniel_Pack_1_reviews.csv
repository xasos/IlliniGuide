Always makes what he wants you to know pretty clear, and isn't hesitant on calling the book stupid and giving us a better or alternative way to do something. Very methodical lectures so he's not hard to follow. Class is still pretty hard though.",04/03/2012,4,4.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
