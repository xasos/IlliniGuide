He allows a great amount of time in class for discussion, which really allows you to understand what you are talking about in the class. He is very nice and techy, so you will use your laptop a lot. Highly recommended, probably my favorite professor this semester.",11/02/2014,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
