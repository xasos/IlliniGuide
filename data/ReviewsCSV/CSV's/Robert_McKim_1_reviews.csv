N/A,average,average,good,0,25750003,0,,good,3,PHIL424,"He's a very knowledgeable professor who is really laid back. Weekly assignments include one page single spaced paper in response to the readings, two long 4 pages single spaced paper and the final exam is an essay exam which he gives 5 questions beforehand and chooses 2 from the 5 in the actual exam. Overall pretty easy and interesting class.",12/17/2015,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Mandatory,average,average,average,0,24031025,0,,good,3,PHIL230,"This class was like one giant discussion. I enjoyed it so much. Provides different perspectives on religion, ethics, and the environment. I'm pretty quiet so I just kinda sat there and listened, but I got so much out of the class. Prof McKim is extremely laid back, intelligent, and not the least bit condescending. Just try to think outside the box.",12/11/2014,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people

For the majority of the course there is a weekly two page writing assignment (one page single spaced) but he will discontinue these as papers and exams draw near. If you ask him, he will clarify any questions. If you show up and engage regularly, he will do his best to help you that he can",07/19/2014,4,4.0,,5,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people
