N/A,good,average,good,2,23363154,1,,good,4,MUS133,"Very interesting class with lots of info that'll really broaden your outlook. But don't take this class if you want an easy A, there's quite a bit of work involved. Lectures can get boring, but to liven things up she brings along (and plays) musical instruments relevant to the country we're studying. Bonus points for the amazing TAs.",06/11/2014,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

Tests are easy, and my TA graded really easily on essays. I would not recommend taking a class with Lillie Gordon because a majority of the class time is spent with her complaining about people using cell phones or laptops.

I don't have any strong feelings toward Prof. Gordon, but what I can say is that she notices when you're not paying attention and gets mad. The tests were hard and I studied a lot.
