She's a relatively clear lecturer in terms of communicating subject content, but she doesn't stress the priority level of the content enough.

Getting a good grade in 233 is like chance due to who your lab TA is and the exams given.  Mirth is so hot though.,12/24/2010,5,5.0,,2,Meh,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

In addition, she prepares zero to give out her poorly written exams to students.  She didn't even print out enough exams for the final so we all had to sit around waiting for an hour.

TAs are useless. Didn't print enough exams for all students on final, so left for an hr while everyone cheated that got the exam at check in, then never came back. Good luck, you'll need lots of it.",12/01/2010,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,17834168,0,,poor,1,CHEM233,Awful teacher. She is extremely rude and does no explain anything. She also expects you to know everything and talks down to you when you don't. Talks to everyone as if she was talking to mentally challenged people or 2 year olds. I end up leaving lecture early every time because she is so annoying an an awful teacher.,11/30/2010,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
