Mandatory,poor,poor,poor,0,26237690,0,,poor,1,CMN220,"He is very egotistical. He acts like he is smarter than you. Would never take again. His feedback is illegible and very, very annoying. He is liberal and without question you will be sure to know that by the end of the course. I do not feel like he understands the average college student. Speaks on privilege; DOESN'T get it.

He's fine at teaching, nothing special, but fine, except the grading seemed all over the place at times and of the 2 or 3 comments he would write on a 5+ page debate brief we could barely even decipher his handwriting :(",06/04/2013,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
