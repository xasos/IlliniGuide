Mandatory,good,average,good,0,26636180,0,,good,5,TSM311,"TSM 311 was the most painless way of knocking out my advanced composition and humanities requirements. Highly recommend the class, especially if you want lots of writing help from instructors. Grading is fairly generous, and there's a nice bonus for going to all the class sessions.",05/23/2016,2,2.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

The writing assignments were paced to be very manageable, and you got freedom to write about whatever interests you personally.  He gave great lectures and grading was prompt and fair.

It's obvious that he wasn't originally planned to teach the class - he's filling in for Singh next year. On the plus side, he is fair and tries to help students as much as possible. He's probably better teaching a course that he's supposed to.",05/08/2010,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
