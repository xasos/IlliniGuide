Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,22092763,0,,good,5,MSE398,Impressed with his lectures. Overall he created this course himself and I was impressed. He has an extensive background in research and lots of great stories. Sherburne provided a lot of insight into the world of academia as well as industry. I'd take this course just so you can get a GPA boost from research.,08/29/2013,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people
