I took &quot;Gender History until 1877&quot; which is truly only about white women in New England, Mayflower-1877. Tests are pretty easy: IDs and essays, however her assignment grading style is very arbitrary.",05/25/2009,3,3.0,,3,It's my life,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,poor,poor,poor,0,15638480,0,,poor,1,HIST471,It is really a shame that she is called Professor.  She is an old women who no longer belongs in Academia.  Her class is not interesting and neither is her lessons.  She very rarely understands what she is teaching or the questions being asked in her class.
