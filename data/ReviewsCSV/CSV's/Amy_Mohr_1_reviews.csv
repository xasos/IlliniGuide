She reads directly off lecture notes, and directly from the text book. Monotone. Boring. Seems pretty stupid... Any English student is capable of doing what she does. Easy essay grader too.",11/24/2008,1,1.0,,3,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I took her major author's class on Willa Cather and thought she was very passionate, engaging, and, most importantly, interested in her students.  Perhaps it's better to take a higher level class with her.",08/26/2008,4,4.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,average,average,average,0,13651770,0,,poor,2,ENGL256,Quite possibly the least engaging professor/teacher I have ever had. Most cut and dry class ever....super boring. You will never feel like doing the work. You are required to do compass posts as well. Easily could be an online class. In class discussions add nothing to the class at all. She simply reads responses from compass.,11/14/2007,3,3.0,,2,Meh,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
