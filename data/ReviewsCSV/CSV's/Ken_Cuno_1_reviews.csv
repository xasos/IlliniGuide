N/A,average,good,average,0,24340540,2,,average,3,HIST200,"By far the worst teacher I have had in college. He's extremely inconsiderate, assigns astronomical amounts of reading,  and uses class as a chance to prove that he knows more than his students. Don't even bother answering his questions because even if your answer is flawless, he'll say you're wrong.

Plenty of readings with discussions every week that really get you to think about what you've read. Paper topics are broad and easy to accomplish if you've done the reading. Cuno does a great job explaining complex topics and relating them to current events. Class act prof.,01/09/2015,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
