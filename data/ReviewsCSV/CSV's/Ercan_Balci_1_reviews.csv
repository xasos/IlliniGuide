His classes are generally small and thus students benefit directly through his willingness to help and answer any problems/questions students may have. Furthermore, he demands little work outside class and is a very generous grader.",10/22/2009,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
