He practices real estate law and deals with closings and what not on a regular basis, so he is extremely knowledgeable.  A very relaxed class atmosphere, and he lectures mostly off his knowledge and experiences in the real estate world.  Great professor.  Only a midterm and final",05/06/2010,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
