Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,22902896,0,,poor,1,MUS130,"Unprofessional, disorganized, boring. Professor Wilson is terrible. The class itself is the worst-structured class imaginable. And for a gened it requires a completely unreasonable amount of work. I don't exaggerate when I say it should really be 4 credit hours. Part of that workload is the difficulty of the tests (thus studying). DO NOT TAKE",03/11/2014,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,average,good,poor,0,22803610,0,,poor,2,MUS130,"Professor Wilson is biased, sassy, and unhelpful. He says a lot of unprofessional remarks like ""whatever,"" and his powerpoints are hard to follow because of the disorganization. Very boring/uninteresting lectures and the professor doesn't seem passionate in his teaching in the slightest bit. Do not take this class if you don't have to.",01/29/2014,4,4.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,WD,,people,people
