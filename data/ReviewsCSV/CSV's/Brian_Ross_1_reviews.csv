You have to know the concepts well and be able to apply them. If you read the book and take good notes you'll be fine. Also, the past exams are REALLY helpful too.

He's a good, fair teacher and tries to keep the lectures interesting by showing at least 1 YouTube clip per lecture. The first test might freak you out, but it gets easier.
