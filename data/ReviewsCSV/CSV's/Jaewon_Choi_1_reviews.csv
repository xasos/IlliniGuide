N/A,average,poor,average,2,25907440,0,,good,3,FIN511,I really enjoyed his class. He has a really sarcastic and dry sense of humor. The homework is graded for completion and all of his exams are multiple choice questions that are almost identical to the homework problems.,01/09/2016,1,1.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,1,23143522,0,,good,5,FIN511,He is one of the best professors in the u of I. He is highly knowledgable and super funny. He comes prepared for his class and he knows what he is talking about. He makes sure that everybody understands his lecture and all the doubts are cleared in class itself. I would advise everyone to take his class.,05/01/2014,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

He explains things quite clear, uses a lot of calculations and writes everything on board, like typical asian-style teaching. The tests were not too easy but you should do well as long as you attend class and do the homework. I enjoyed the class and learned a lot.",01/11/2014,3,3.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,person

I learned nothing about picking stocks from this class, so it was a total waste of time. The tests were hilariously easy, and the biweekly HW was just for credit. Students often challenged his logic, and he had no response. Simply not a good professor.",07/23/2011,1,1.0,,1,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
