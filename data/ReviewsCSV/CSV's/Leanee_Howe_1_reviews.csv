Does not follow syllabus closely.  You can skim most books and be ok.  Her novel is great, much better than I expected.  Lots of group work and class discussion in this class",12/04/2008,1,1.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I was expecting another history class, however, this class is an insightful journey through the creation story of America and Indian literature.",12/02/2008,2,2.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
