Otherwise, he is the best faculty member in Arch. History. I had taken his class for the past three semesters. His lecture is clear; uses lots of images, and he didn't just read from the script. :)",11/08/2005,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Unfortunately I don't respect the man because: 1) during a real world fire alarm he risked many sutdent's lives by wasting 5 minutes on collecting a test that we were working on.

You need only study the thing on the study guide but not all mentioned in lecture. (everything on test is from the study guide).
