Not difficult, but definitely not a blow-off. Attendance is necessary if you want to do well on the tests, because he rarely posts any notes or videos online.",05/01/2010,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The professor is nerdy, but in a good way ;) Readings aren't necessary as long as you go to class and the tests are pretty easy as long as you take notes.

All you have to do for his tests is spit back out what your notes say word for word... that'll give you an Auto-A.  Minimal reading.
