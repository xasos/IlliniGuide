N/A,good,average,good,0,18637917,0,,good,5,TAM251,"Agreed with most reviews. Only things to add, exams are low points (i.e. out of 28) so missing 1 point is a bigger dent to your grade so be careful.  Do HW, do practice exams, go to class and take good notes, and you'll be fine.  Awesome Prof, funny, exciting (for Solid Mechanics) and he cares about making real engineers!",05/19/2011,2,2.0,,4,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
