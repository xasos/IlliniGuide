N/A,average,poor,average,0,21347260,0,,average,2,ENGL109,Not the best when it comes to teaching. Struggles to convey ideas clearly. Attempts to stick to rigid plan for each class so she asks questions looking for specific answers from us. It's just like we're filling in the blanks for her. Tries too hard to pull ideas from books that just aren't there. Pretty frustrated with her teaching style.,02/17/2013,1,1.0,,3,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
