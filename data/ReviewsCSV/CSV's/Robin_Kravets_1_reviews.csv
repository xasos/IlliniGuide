Then, she dropped the final which was great. Had class presentations that were easy. She had deadlines but changed them all the time.

There's a lot of material to cover, and I think she does a good job explaining things at the level that needs to be understood for this course. Lots of code examples in the slides, and if you ask questions she will stop and repeat things.

Robin was extremely rude to students and presented MPs that were near impossible to do based on lecture notes. Really a shame since 241 covers great material.
