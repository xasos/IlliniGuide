Her class is challenging by stretching your writing skills, but she makes the class fun.",09/12/2011,2,2.0,,4,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

If you take her class, she will &quot;help&quot; you to get one more low letter grade and give you extra workload compared with other sections. All my friends in other sections got A and did much less work. Don't take her class, she ruins everything and takes time!",05/21/2011,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
