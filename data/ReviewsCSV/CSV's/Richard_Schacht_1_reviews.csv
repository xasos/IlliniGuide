N/A,average,good,poor,0,23322562,0,,poor,2,PHIL414,"Schacht is a smart man, but an awful teacher. He lectures the entire class period and leaves no time for questions. The rare times when someone does ask a question, he typically has a sarcastic and rude reply that doesn't clarify anything, but rather makes the person who asked the question feel inferior for asking it.",05/28/2014,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Although 411 was formally a lecture-discussion class, there was no discussion and not even any questions asked during class.  Visiting Schacht in office hours is an intimidating experience.

 On the other hand he knows the material well and conveys it effectively, works the readings and lectures into a comprehensive whole, and makes excellent selections of topics/work",11/04/2005,2,2.0,,2,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
