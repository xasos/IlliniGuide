N/A,good,poor,good,0,18688239,0,,good,5,ANSC250,"EASY class. No final. Just go to lecture and discussion, do weekend posts, and take a few quizzes. Class is a bit one sides (animal rights) so it may make some people mad. Some weeks are very emotional too. Guests speakers are great overall. This class is great to take with ANSC101 if you want conflicting viewpoints.",06/01/2011,1,1.0,,4,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She will take student's reading materials if it does not pertain to class, call students out for 'not paying attention' in class, and is very one-sided. I recommend the class itself, but only if it is not with Professor Fischer.",03/31/2011,3,3.0,,2,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I don't appreciate the biased books we were asked to read. Most classwork was about animal welfare, not animals' place in society as the course description reads.

She can't write a decent exam question to save her life - everything was vague or confusing.  She is selfish, not open to other opinions, has no interest in students.

Excellent class to take for the life science gen ed. Course is all about dogs and cats, so if you like animals, you'll love it. Very interesting subject material, enjoyed the class.
