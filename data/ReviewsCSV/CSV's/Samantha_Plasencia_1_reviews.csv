Expectations were unclear and syllabus was inconsistent. Grading is extremely subjective. She lacks conciseness, clarity, and comes off as overly-abrasive and self-proclaiming.",04/06/2016,4,4.0,,1,N/A,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Not only do you have to write this huge paper, you have to do the weekly emails, weekly reports, connections, and argument mapping. On top of that she still wants to have lecture on long, boring readings that have nothing to do with what anyone is writing.
