N/A,good,good,good,0,16786201,0,,good,4,ECON203,"She is the antithesis of ECON 202'S Colleen Schulz in so many ways it is actually quite amusing. She is very enthusiastic about her subject and her work, genuinely interested in answering questions and helping you out in any way possible, and has none of the attitude problems that unfortunately afflicts  Schultz. Very much recommended!",02/05/2010,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,16759347,0,,good,4,ECON302,She is extremely helpful and available at all times.  Her test is very fair but you must attend to her classes If you study the lecture and in class notes and skim through the book you will receive A- if you want to do really good on the exams please do attend to her review sessions.   I hope you are the lucky one to take her class,01/26/2010,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I got sick & my midterm weight was shifted to my final for 80% of my total grade. If you're not great at calc expect a horrible flaming death. The exam questions build off each other so if you screw up a part you're F*cked!",01/16/2010,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

As the person below me said, go to class for her examples because they are on  hw and the exams.

Midterm and final counted for 80% of the grade but were pretty easy and she let us know what to study in the reviews.

Final exam was 50% of the grade, and she didn't give much clue as to what would be on it. Midterm and final were bother very short, so if you missed a few questions it had a substantial impact your final grade.",12/17/2009,3,3.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
