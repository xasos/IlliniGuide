She has some specific rules, but on the most part she is laid back. Her office hours are really helpful. You dont really need the Rules for Writers book, just the inexpensive notes booklet.

Make sure to take notes, especially on vocab words, which always appear on the tests.  She was a big help in a class that is notoriously difficult.

Follow guidelines and you will be fine.  Attendance is mandatory, but there also aren't any textbooks to buy (ignore what is listed to buy &quot;Rules for Writers&quot;).  The only thing you need to buy are some inexpensive notes.",12/06/2006,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
