She generates a random list and you have to be there if she calls your name or you lose points.  She's an awesome teacher, I highly recommend taking her class.  I wish she had another class I could take.",12/01/2015,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person

Professor McDermott's ways with words clarified any confusion I had reading the dense texts of Marx, Weber, etc.   Moreover her lectures made me really think about society's structure in ways I never imagined.

Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,24434328,0,,good,5,SOC200,"I dreaded this class. Sociological Theory sounds terrible, but it was the complete opposite. If anyone else taught this class, it would have bored me to death, but McDermott explained everything so clearly. She made her lectures interesting, engaging, and easy to pay attention to. I would take any class taught by her, no matter what the subject.",03/05/2015,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,23849161,0,,good,5,SOC200,I literally thought this was going to be the hardest class of my semester because she comes off the first day pretty strict and it feels as though you will have to work really hard.  This was really not the case.  She is awesome and if you just listen to her in class- you will do fine on the tests.  I would def take any of her classes again!,11/19/2014,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

The way she engages students made me very at ease and willing to participate, even though it wasn't required. She is forgiving if you haven't had time to read the text, but will still get you involved in the material in another way.
