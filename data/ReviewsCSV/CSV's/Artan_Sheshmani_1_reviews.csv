Very helpful in office hours. The class is not easy; it takes a LOT of work. But if you really listen to what he is saying, ask questions, and put enough time in, you can succeed.",02/28/2014,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He REALLY knows the subject well.  Doesn't promote participation because he is intimidating and certainly doesn't let you down easily if you're wrong.  I found him smart and interesting, but not a great teacher.",12/11/2007,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
