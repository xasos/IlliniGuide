It's not exactly a difficult class; however the instructor is completely disorganized, frequently posts the wrong assignments, takes forever to return grades, and generally seems to have no idea what she's doing.",11/12/2010,3,3.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Go to lecture, take notes (she gives you an outline and you just fill it in), and for the tests memorize the notes. The entire test is word for word from the notes. She thinks she's all that but she's not - at least 25 pts. e.c. given though.",07/17/2008,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,poor,average,0,14213238,0,,average,3,CHLH206,Class is ridiculously easy. There are extra credit opportunities you should take advantage of. But Rucker can be arrogant and rude.

She has no respect for students, cannot pronounce the simplest words in the English language, and is rarely prepared for class. I hope you're not looking for accurate information about human sexuality, because she perpetuates myths and stereotypes",03/12/2008,1,1.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
