I would highly recommend his collection class or his public art class. He's a sweetie and a cutie.,03/19/2012,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Other than that he's actually a really nice guy, very willing to help students. You will never pronounce ""origin"" the same after this class (""or-IDGE-in""). His assignments are useful and we learn a lot with them.",03/17/2012,4,4.0,,4,It's my life,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The class certainly isn't a blow off, it requires a lot of studying and memorization, and essay portions of exams are difficult to score well on.  Lectures can get boring and vazquez seems kinda out there. But super nice guy and def knows his stuff!!

I have watched The Office on my laptop through every class, and I still have enough knowledge to get myself through the class on my own. It's not easy, but if you study hard for the exams, you never need to step foot in the classroom.

Super-disorganized, had to leave class to go get a presentation on CD that he left at home. Often late, hates the concept of &quot;chronological order&quot;.
