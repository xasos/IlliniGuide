N/A,good,good,good,0,17570138,0,,good,4,LING307,"I loved this class. She is not only a good teacher, but an established researcher in lexical semantics. The texbook is rather dry - but she uses many examples of real-world applications of semantics - especially from computational linguistics. This helps a lot. The grader though, was so and so.. but she is very fast in responding to emails.",09/02/2010,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,poor,average,poor,0,16059486,0,,poor,1,LING307,"Missed many classes, barely read the book or understood the material, managed an A! Bizarre. Doesn't natively speak English, yet teaches English semantics. Very sweet lady though, nice and calm--gives full credit if you just spew out what you remember on the tests. Apparently not good at keeping office hours though.",07/23/2009,3,3.0,,2,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
