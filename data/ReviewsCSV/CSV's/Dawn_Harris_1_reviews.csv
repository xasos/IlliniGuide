She shaped my voice more than I could have imagined in the short time I've been with her. She is fun and she will help you select repertoire that you find fun and things that are challenging, ultimately helping you grow immensely. Crazy good!",04/13/2016,3,3.0,,5,N/A,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

She is incredible. She gave me confidence, a new skill set, and the courage to step out and be me. I would highly recommend her to incoming students!",12/19/2014,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people

I have worked with her in Bloomington in The Pantagraph Holiday Spectacular and Prairie Fire Theatre.  She works well with both large and small groups, both amateur and professional.  She sets high performance standards, but is fair to everyone. Work with her if you get a chance!",09/08/2006,2,2.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
