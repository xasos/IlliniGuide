N/A,good,average,good,0,13017759,0,,good,4,CS101,Professor Gambill is a good teacher at the university. He is very helpful when it comes to the curriculum and he finds ways to make things beneficial for you in the future. He applies a lot of the material to future use. The only difficult part about the class is it is very based on exams and tough material.
