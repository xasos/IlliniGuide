N/A,good,average,average,0,24004310,0,,good,4,FR134,"Mme. Benoit has been very nice and fairly lenient, in my opinion. The class is entirely in French and she speaks rather quickly, but she speaks in English if the whole class seems lost. Her grading on written assignments is very constructive but doesn't kill your grade. She's often flexible with homework deadlines. I found her to be very pleasant.
