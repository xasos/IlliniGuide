Test are hard to prepare because there is no sort of guide, and grading is very subjective. Even though attendance is required, your better off learning off of cliffnotes.

The class set up is a disorganized mess, grading is extremely subjective and unstructured, and class is boring and not the slightest bit interactive.

Not helpful, even if you see him in office hours. Papers have letter grades only, no comments. He knows his Shakespeare, but does nothing to increase class understanding.

No need to be in class; use sparknotes and you have replaced his teaching.
