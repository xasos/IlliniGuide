Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,25820209,0,,good,4,ESE200,Tomkin has a unique style of teaching that is different and it grabs your attention. The lectures are meant to get you thinking rather than just sit there and listen.   The exams however are tricky and many of us didn't find out until the very end. The question could be asking something but he really means something else. Look for keywords.,12/24/2015,4,4.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,B,,people,people

The professor is nice, funny, and really into the material, but the lectures are required and are 100% pointless.

We barely did anything in lecture, and there are way too many discussion assignments and homework. Even the extra credit was difficult to earn. There are four exams.

With Tomkin, not only are the tests really hard they're scheduled at the most inconvenient times like the day after spring break, the last day of class (keep in mind their is also a final).

First, he teaches and gives grades in an Australian style. He is a tough grader and has very high expectations of students.

The questions are too difficult and tricky. review guides only help so much. Class is interactive but don't Have To participate tho. doesn't help in office hours at all! so don't miss a class and expect help.,05/09/2013,5,5.0,,1,It's my life,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I assumed he'd teach the class the same way as Altaner did, which through the grapevine was easily.  It's a 100 level geology class, he should realize half the class is there as a blow off.
