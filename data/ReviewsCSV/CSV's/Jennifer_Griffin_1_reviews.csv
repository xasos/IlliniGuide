She is very quick to cut you down if you make a mistake either in class or on a test/paper. She also calls students out in class to make examples of them. For the level of the class, it is graded too harshly and her expectations are extremely high.",10/15/2010,5,5.0,,2,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,17652105,0,,poor,2,FR207,She is responsible for killing my love of French. Grades incredibly hard for the first important class counting for the major/minor. Expectations are way too high for young undergraduate students. Lacks the ability to connect with students and criticizes with a rude and abrupt attitude.
