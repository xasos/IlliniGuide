His slides are very well organized, and he throws in interesting tidbits. He's approachable, and office hours are helpful.

The first test kind of shocked everyone (we all did poorly) but if you work at it, the class is not impossible. You learn A LOT!  Go to lectures, take notes, and study! The class is 96% tests and quizzes so you really can't earn points somewhere else.",10/14/2015,4,4.0,,4,It's my life,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
