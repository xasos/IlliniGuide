Mandatory,poor,poor,poor,1,26516942,0,,poor,1,CMN323,Not the best teacher at all. He assigns lots of assignments for completion only though and gives all A's. The class was really fun and was actually pretty useful. He does drone on about random stuff but overall he can be eccentric which is a bit funny. There is work to be done but as long as you do it you guarantee an A. Not bad for a 300 class.,05/09/2016,1,1.0,,2,N/A,1.5,1.5,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,person

I'm pretty sure he was aware of this because he usually brought Monster for us to sip on halfway through class. It was cool, but it's bad if you know you're putting your own class to sleep.

In lecture, Professor Jacobs just talked in circles. I stopped going. The take-home exams were confusing and there was a 6 (3 page) fallacy project due at the end of the semester.
