If you're an engineer who likes structure and an exact list of requirements for an assignment, get ready for something new. Hilarious guy, lots of fun - I actually looked forward to this class. Good discussion, all projects and presentations.",12/19/2005,1,1.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
