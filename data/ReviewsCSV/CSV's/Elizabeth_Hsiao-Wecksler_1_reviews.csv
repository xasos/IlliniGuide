Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24647014,0,,good,4,ME370,"Great Professor! She does care about the students, which can't be said for all professors. The lectures  and tests are pretty straight forward. Can be tough at times during design reviews but she's just challenging you to make a better design. If you like to design and build than you'll like this class. I would recommend her as an advisor as well.",04/22/2015,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

N/A,average,good,average,0,16965459,0,,average,3,ME370,I was told she was good and taught well but I think something has changed. Her lectures are not too helpful when asking her questions. She has in-class assignments but you can figure out when because she posts them on her lectures so you just have to look ahead of time. Homework started easy but got harder and is not really covered on the tests.,04/08/2010,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Exams were easy and focused on the basics of the material. The course was mainly centered around the two design projects and she discussed them a lot in class which was helpful.",06/02/2008,2,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
N/A,good,poor,good,2,12585821,0,,good,4,ME370,"She did a decent job teaching the class.  Lectures were pretty good.  Tests were extremely easy,  which was fine but also means no curve.  I think ME 370 was one of those classes that nobody really hates, but nobody really likes it either.  Just do the homeworks and don't fall too far behind.",12/12/2006,1,1.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
