She averages the scores of each unit, instead of taking the average of quizzes, homework, etc across the whole course.

Even though her lectures are online, they're vague sometimes and she goes into great detail in class. IClicker points go towards your grade. Instead of tests, she does 6 &quot;quizzes&quot; and gives you the essay part in advance. I didn't do the readings which is probably why I didn't get an A.
