She is an extremely interesting person, and very funny in a crude way but that is my humor so it works. She doesn't use profanity in a &quot;I'm trying to be hip and appeal to these young kids&quot; kind of way, it's just how she is which is good and makes it not annoying.",12/01/2008,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
