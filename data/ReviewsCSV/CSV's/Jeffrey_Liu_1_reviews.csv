N/A,average,good,average,0,17916769,0,,average,2,STAT200,"Jeffrey seems really nice and he tries so hard to give you a ton of points. But the bottom line is that coming to his lecture mostly just confuses you more, even if you have had previous stats classes. Over the course of the semester I don't think it was possible for someone with no stats knowledge to pass the class the way he taught it. :(",12/11/2010,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
