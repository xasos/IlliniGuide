Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,23799674,0,,good,5,MCB252,Dr. Bellini is one of the best MCB professors I've had. His lectures are clear and tests are fair. Don't skip class on Unofficial because the lecture was one of the funniest I've been to in college. Bellini is also really approachable outside of class and you can talk to him about anything. He'll even go out for coffee with students. He's great!,11/12/2014,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
