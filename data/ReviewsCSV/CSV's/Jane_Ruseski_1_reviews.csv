N/A,poor,good,poor,0,11910624,0,,poor,1,421,"She is completely unprofessional. She has no interest in teaching and refuses to offer assistance during office hours. Often cancels her scheduled office hours too, without prior notice. She obviously does not know the material she is &quot;teaching&quot; and cannot answer questions. If there's any justice in the world, she will be fired immediately!!",05/18/2006,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
