If you want to get some good FEM knowledge at U of I stick to Dr. Duarte. Stay away from Paulino.,12/13/2013,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,poor,good,poor,0,20313204,0,,poor,1,CEE570,"Passes out tons of his own publications expecting you to read them. Class is straight from powerpoint slides 95% of the time. Gave a misleading practice exam that was not related to actual exam content. Stressed final would cover a majority of topics after 2nd exam - it did not, and was extremely difficult.

He gives some ridiculously long hw's. the projects are the only useful things i got out of this class.  the tests are outrageously hard and you are lucky if you can finish within the allotted time. it is true that some of his own students do not like working for him",04/10/2009,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

It is quite surprising that AE420 (and ME471), which is a 400-level class, covers more material on the finite element s than this class.
