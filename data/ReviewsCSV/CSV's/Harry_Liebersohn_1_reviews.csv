N/A,good,poor,good,0,23599867,0,,good,5,HIST350,Wow this class is about early modern Euro-History on Romantic and political themes. Professor Liebersohn engaged everyone  throughout discussions. The amount of readings are high. A fair grader on papers with understandable feedbacks. I suggest visit him during office hours so he can see that you are making an effort to do well in class. ,09/18/2014,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

I attended every lecture and everything I learned came from my own reading of the textbook. Tests are all Identification questions and essays. Tests don't deal with lecture.
