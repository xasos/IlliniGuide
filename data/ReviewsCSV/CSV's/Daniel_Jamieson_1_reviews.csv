Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,25351533,0,,poor,1,CHEM102,"Jamieson flat out sucks at teaching. He would teach a lesson and you would leave even more confused than when you first started. Even as you gained even a tiny bit of understanding, he would shoot that to hell on homework assignments and exams.
