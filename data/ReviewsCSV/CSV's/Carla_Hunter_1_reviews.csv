Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25380403,0,,good,4,PSYC336,"Dr. Hunter really puts you into current engagements concerning the internet and virtual communities. Class is engaging, but heavily relies on participation to make it worthwhile, so I would avoid if not really into talking. Very worthwhile class overall, exams are easy, group project and own research throughout the course of the class.",11/10/2015,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
