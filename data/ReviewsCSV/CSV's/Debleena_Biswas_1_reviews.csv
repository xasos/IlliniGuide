N/A,average,poor,average,0,15393315,0,,average,2,RHET105,"I don't know what everyone else is talking about, this teacher is easy. I showed up 15-20 minutes late everyday and she said nothing, not to mention I don't recall writing a single paper while sober and still got an A in the class. I never read a thing, she completely explained the readings in lecture. She was weird and I found the class boring.",01/20/2009,1,1.0,,3,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Her class was my hardest one but I put in the hard work and put my heart and soul into the research paper and got an A in the end.  I may have been overly stressed out and bored at her lectures but with hard work and participation, you will become a great writter.",01/14/2009,4,4.0,,4,Low,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Always was at least ten minutes late, yet she yelled at us for not being on time. Too many assignments, boring lecture. Definitely avoid her.",05/13/2008,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
