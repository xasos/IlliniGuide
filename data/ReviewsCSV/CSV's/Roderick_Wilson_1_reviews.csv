I always procrastinated reading until the last few days before an exam; however, he allows a cheat sheet to be used on tests (which saved my life. I swear I wrote in a 6pt font). Read everything and spend some quality time on the essays. Re-read the chapters as well.",12/30/2013,2,2.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,person

He does not take attendance in lecture, but there are absurd amounts of reading. 4 exams and 3 1000-word essays. This class requires a lot of your time for you to do well. Avoid the course if you can, but if you have to take it, he's probably the best option.",12/13/2013,5,5.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

While titled as a ""culture"" course, it was everything but. He requires you to memorize fine details of Japanese history. Sadly, the lectures do not pertain to the course as he starts lecture 20min late with going off on multiple tangents.",12/17/2012,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
