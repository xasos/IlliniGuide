She is constantly asking remedial questions to the class to generate discussion, however she is constantly talking down to the students and insulting their intelligence.",02/20/2013,1,1.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Reads from the slides and to get her ego fix she comes up with weird things so people will not miss class, such as giving an exam review a week before the exam by surprise. Her teaching is worthless.I hate that I have to pay UofI big bucks for this.",10/19/2011,2,2.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
