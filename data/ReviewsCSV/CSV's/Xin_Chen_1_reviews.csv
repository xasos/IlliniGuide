Mandatory,poor,average,poor,0,25935886,1,,poor,1,IE411,The lowest score I have ever had. I could not understand most of the word said by the instructor. The ppt has no use. Nothing about the large system optimization. This class is just solving the linear equations. I will never take any course from him again. Only thing I could do is warn you guys to avoid him.,01/13/2016,3,3.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,person,people

Rarely gives partial credit. Difficult to understand at times, course was structured awkwardly. Still, final grades are given somewhat subjectively, and students who regularly attend lecture and know concepts are rewarded.",12/10/2006,3,3.0,,4,Low,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Lecture slides can be confusing, I suggest going straight from the book. Expect lengthy homework assignments every couple weeks. Will tell you exactly how many and what types of problems to expect on exams. Very nice guy.",12/22/2005,2,2.0,,4,Low,3.5,3.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
