N/A,average,good,average,0,22663508,0,,average,2,PHIL101,"Not gonna lie, this class was definitely one of my hardest ones but it's not so much Derek's fault as the complex topics that were covered. Philosophy in general is not simple and explaining it seems pretty impossible. I will admit that Derek expects a lot out of his students than we're prepared for considering it's a beginner's class.",12/27/2013,4,4.0,,3,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

People should avoid complaining about the reading, as he does not demand everyone does %100 of it, let alone understand %100.  For an intro class it is very informative.  I think most people take PHIL classes expecting an easy A, and that is a false assumption.",12/20/2013,1,1.0,,3,It's my life,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,average,poor,0,21559575,0,,poor,1,PHIL101,This guy doesn't know how to teach even if his life depended on it. He sits there and simply blabbers gibberish at you and has you do readings that he even admits are way too high for this class. Its an intro class and he clearly doesn't know that. Also he's very offensive and just plain idiotic. DO NOT take his class. I regret it every single day.,04/18/2013,3,3.0,,1,It's my life,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
