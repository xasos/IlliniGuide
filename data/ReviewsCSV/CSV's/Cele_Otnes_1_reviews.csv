Exams are easy, just review her slides and articles (and there are no more pop quizzes). Homework, however, is useless and not even included on exams, but you have to do it...Overall, a nice easy A.",12/07/2011,1,1.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I don't think she does a good job of making powerpoint slides...it is very disorganized. She only quiz you on stuff she thinks is important. Textbook is a rip off, you need it for homework and 1/5th of your studying.",11/05/2011,2,2.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I took the class last semester, there were pop quizes in class so attendance is mandatory. The online homework is very easy. If you skim through the book you'll get an A, if you don't then if you have a good amount of common sense you could probably pull off a B",01/20/2011,1,1.0,,4,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
