It's basically stuff you learned in 5th grade, such as how to write a letter. That, however, is not what your grade is based on. If you make one small citing or bibliographical error you get penalized ridiculous amounts. (continued)",03/13/2010,1,1.0,,2,Meh,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
