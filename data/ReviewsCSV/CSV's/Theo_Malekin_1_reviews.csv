Sometimes seems like the absent-minded professor, but he is very engaging and enthusiastic about the subject matter he's teaching. Gives thorough answers and points out interesting moments in the literature.

N/A,good,average,good,0,25504211,0,,good,5,CWL252,A very solid professor. I was very interested in the material and enjoyed reading and the class was pretty straightforward because of that. There's a few papers and things but the grading is very fair. A couple straightforward group projects but nothing crazy. Overall a solid teacher and interesting class.,11/30/2015,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people

Not Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,25176429,0,,good,5,SCAN250,Responsible and passionate professor. His English accent is very impressive! Theo is very knowledgeable and always willing to help. The exams or papers are not difficult at all as long as you go to the lecture and do the readings. Don't be afraid to ask him questions because he is very patient. He doesn't like students to be late tho.,09/07/2015,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Ask a question and he'll spend 10 min telling you everything he knows about the topic enthusiastically. Exams are fair. Replies to emails within 24 hrs. Take good notes, he doesn't post lectures.

Mandatory,good,average,good,1,23199270,0,,good,4,SCAN251,"Very interesting class with only a moderate amount of readings.  Discussions were interesting as well.  The 2 exams are graded harshly, and the final paper is inconveniently assigned during finals.  Can be rude/lose his temper easily if he gets upset, which happened a few times.  Just study harder than you think you need to and you'll do well.",05/08/2014,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
