If you completed 80% of it, you got 100% in the homework category. He made the lowest test score worth only 9% of your grade. Because we weren't able to finish the last chapter, he didn't put it on the final. Watch out though, final was difficult.",05/18/2015,2,2.0,,5,Low,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people

The best thing about his class is that the midterms are like the practice test and you actually do learn the material.
