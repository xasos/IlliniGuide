Wolfe is a nice guy, but the boring 90-minute lecture will put you right to sleep every time. Don't feel guilt-tripped into going to the review sessions, either - this is where Wolfe's scatterbrained nature really shines. He'll take 2 solid hours to do like 10 problems. Do old exams on your own.",12/19/2005,2,2.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
