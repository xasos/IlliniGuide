This class is nothing like it sounds, but if you need an easy elective I would do it. 5 short questions on plays and 2 exams.",05/07/2013,3,3.0,,1,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

However, if you are good, she will grade your speeches harder and you will receive a lower letter grade. Class is pointless but you can only miss two classes before participation points are deducted.",12/27/2012,4,4.0,,1,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
