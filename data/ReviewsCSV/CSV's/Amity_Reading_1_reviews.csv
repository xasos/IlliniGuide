N/A,good,poor,good,0,15383132,0,,good,5,ENGL202,Love her!  She's so funny and our class was hilarious.  You are allowed 6 absences (regardless of excused or not) but there are attendance points.  Always interesting and after our class got to know each other better we would hold office hours/study sessions at Murphy's! Take notes (hint: exams!) and keep up with reading. Her e-mails are funny!,01/16/2009,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,average,poor,average,0,12773465,0,,poor,2,RHET105,"She likes to be funny, and does not make class boring. But always complaning in front of the class about having to grade papers and blah blah. So she definitely does not want to be there. This is not encouraging students at all. SHE chose to be a TA...  And her clothing style may be different as she says, but it's totally wack.",01/14/2007,1,1.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,3,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
