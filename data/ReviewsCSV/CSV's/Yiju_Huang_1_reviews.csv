Mandatory,good,average,good,0,22491254,0,,good,5,CHIN1010,Yiju is an excellent teacher. She is intelligent kind and fair. I love being in her class and I hope to take her other classes. The thing about learning languages in college is that it is necessary to spend A LOT of time studying them. Absence will affect your grade. It is so much more effective to come to her class in order to learn the language.,12/10/2013,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people
