N/A,good,poor,good,0,13924409,0,,good,5,SOCW200,"Sharen is by far one of the nicest people I have ever met. She is extremely enthusiastic about her job, and is willing to do whatever it takes to help her students do well in the class. Very easy, you dont have to go to every class.. but make sure you get the powerpoints. Papers are extremely easy, tests are also easy if you study.",12/30/2007,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
