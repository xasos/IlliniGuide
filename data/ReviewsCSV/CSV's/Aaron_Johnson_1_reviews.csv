He allowed a retake, and genuinely cares about students understanding the material and is great at visually explaining things.  By the end of the class, I loved it! Would definitely take it again. Learned a lot!!! ",05/07/2015,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

However, Dr. Johnson realized that it was a hard test and let you retake it for an average score with open book and notes.  Lets you use a cheat sheet on the final which is nice.  Material is super hard but understandable if you study enough. ",04/30/2015,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24557681,0,,good,4,SHS411,"I previously rated Dr. Johnson, and I think he deserves a correction. At first, I was disappointed that he was not clear on the physics material he was teaching us at the start of the semester. However, he has made every effort to fix that and it is clear he wants his students to succeed. I definitely recommend him and say he is a great teacher.

However, he is constantly questioning himself on information he provides, editing slides for mistakes and overall looking very uninformed about the info he is supposed to be teaching us. BUT He is 100% a kind guy, who is always there to help. ",03/09/2015,4,4.0,,4,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Highly recommend going just because he makes it so fun. Extremely fair as well, had exams either on Compass or in class open-note. Easily the best disorders class I have taken.",03/08/2013,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
