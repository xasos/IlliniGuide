Not Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,22504944,0,,good,5,MSE443,"I was really worried because Bellon was bad for 402, but this class is great! Definitely one of my favorite classes I've taken so far. Bellon is much more clear when teaching about alloys, and he offers so much more material to learn from including practice exams. Great class.",12/11/2013,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people

Ultimately this grade is for the Alloys class, because he is a good teacher for it. He is very fair and willing to help, and his attempts at humor are the best!",10/03/2013,2,2.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,21588477,0,,poor,2,MSE402,"This class is aweful. Bellon goes through proofs all class but never explains what they are about. The lecture notes are literally the only resource for the class, no books. He refuses to offer solutions to hw after it is due and tells TA's not to help answer homework problems. You are literally on your own. Worst class I've ever taken.",04/23/2013,5,5.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
