Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,26671806,0,,poor,1,IB103,Dr. Jacobs is an arrogant and horrible professor. Exams are tough for the material he covers and the questions seem to have two correct answers where guessing is your only option. His lectures are scattered and difficult to follow. He seems to explain things in the most round about way possible often leaving the class confused. Overall awful class,05/30/2016,4,4.0,,1,N/A,1,1.0,1,No,No,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Tests are hard. Will not take a class w/ him in the future. Very boring, repetitive lectures. Too much animation on presentations.

His test questions are kind of a struggle and you sometimes have to dissect them to find the right answer, but he's a nice guy who truly loves being a professor.

His tests are hard because he forces you to synthesize information in the same way. Don't take his courses if you're looking to regurgitate facts. Take his courses if you want to become more thoughtful.,04/02/2015,4,4.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people

His lectures are boring, some of his test questions have multiple correct answers (but you have to choose the BEST right answer), and he is arrogant.

N/A,average,good,poor,1,21963831,2,,poor,2,IB103,Most arrogant professor I have ever seen. He knows some old stuffs very well but is unaware of recent advancements in science. Bigger problem is- he deeply believes that he is the best professor and he needs no improvement. He has a perception that long and confusing questions can best test the students ability.,07/12/2013,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
