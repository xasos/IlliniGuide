Mandatory,good,average,good,1,26014797,0,,good,5,CLCV220,"Dr. Traill is a fantastic professor. She is very knowledgeable,  and flexible about deadlines if you talk to her. Gives great feedback and allows rewrites on essays to improve your grade. Lots  of fun in-class activities and discussions, she tried hard to make sure we enjoyed our class experience.

There is a ton of material to know in this class, and it is brutal trying to memorize it all if you don't care about the subject matter. Do not take if you aren't very passionate about the subject!!!",05/26/2014,4,4.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Way harder than a 100 level should be, especially since CLCV 115 was a class people take to get an A. She also sticks the mic into her mouth when she talks, so you can hear her moving her mouth during lecture.",12/18/2013,5,5.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,B,,people,people

She makes a disgusting noise with her mouth when she lectures. Her tests are supposed to be based off of the reading questions but they aren't.
