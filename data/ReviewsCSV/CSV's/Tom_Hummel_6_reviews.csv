He's a nice guy, he explains concepts well in lecture, and he'll answer any questions you have, but his exams are very hard. The kinds of questions he asks on exams are tricky and much more in depth than homework problems or quiz questions, so you really have to put an effort into the class to succeed.",12/21/2009,4,4.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
