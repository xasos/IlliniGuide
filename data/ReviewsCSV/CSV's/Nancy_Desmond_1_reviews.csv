N/A,good,poor,good,0,11210131,0,,good,4,ACCY200,"Very stress-free course, though you can't help but learn a basic foundation of accounting, tax code, and business ethics. No book, no exams, little homework. As long as you attend class regularly, it's a guaranteed A. Enjoyable class, and the book she'll have you read, &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot; about the Enron scandal, should be a must read for any student.",12/19/2005,1,1.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
