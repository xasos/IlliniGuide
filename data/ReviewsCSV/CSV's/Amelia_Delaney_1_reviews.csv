The course required as much work as a 300 level class should. The content is interesting and Amy is more than willing to help if you put in the effort. Start early on the workshop and go to class.

However she is pretty strict and not flexible with deadlines. Also this class requires online discussions every week which can be redundant and very annoying. There is no book but a lot of online reading. Tests are easy, GO TO THE REVIEW SESSIONS",01/04/2012,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Then again, this was a lecture with 300 people so I don?t blame her. If you put the time into the class, the material and lectures are interesting.

The posts we do are interesting and even though they take up time, we only meet in lecture twice a week, so it isn't too bad. Even if she isn't the easiest person to get along with, she does try to give students a lot of help.",12/05/2011,4,4.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She keeps to her rules about deadlines, etc., which I appreciate so some jerk doesn't get an extension when I turned my work in on time. She has helped me more than onece with my work.
