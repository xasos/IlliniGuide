N/A,average,good,poor,0,15717852,0,,poor,2,LING400,"He's still a bad teacher. Doesn't know what he picks for homeworks, so unclear and such an awkward weirdo, frankly. Incredibly horrible tests as mentioned below, but 400 was easy anyway. Avoid him not because of the class, but because of his personality...",04/27/2009,4,4.0,,1,Low,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,poor,poor,0,15291178,0,,poor,2,LING100,Pretty terrible. Lectures were an unorganized mess. He stumbled over himself constantly and the only thing that really kept the class alive were the TAs. Exams were really poorly written to the point where questions had to be thrown out. This was his first semester and he seemed to be improving by the end so maybe he just needs time.,12/29/2008,1,1.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
