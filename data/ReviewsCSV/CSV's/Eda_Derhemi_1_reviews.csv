She's very friendly if you get to know her, but is matter-of-fact during lecture.

She certainly knows what she's talking about.  The exams are also very straightforward.  Good teacher!,10/17/2011,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I had her for my first semester of Italian and she expects you to know to much for your first semester ever. Do not reccomend her. She will call on you and if you do not know the answer, wil wait for you to figure it out, which can be a HUGE problem for Italian",11/26/2009,4,4.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The major problem&#63; The questions asked for the paper were INSANELY unclear. This WOMAN was unclear about EVERYTHING.

The class is called media and democracy, but she treats it like let's talk about our favorite philosophers. If that's your thing, enjoy. But if you're looking for a discussion about how media affects democracy, wrong class.",03/19/2008,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,3,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
