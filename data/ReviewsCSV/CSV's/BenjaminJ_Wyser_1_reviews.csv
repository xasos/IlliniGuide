Mandatory,good,average,good,0,26361948,0,,good,4,MATH347,"Wonderful lecturer. As a math minor, he really helped me develop my mathematical maturity. His lectures were clear and informative, and helped me fill in the gaps that the book missed. I would highly recommend taking him as your first upper-level math professor.",04/23/2016,3,3.0,,4,N/A,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
Mandatory,average,poor,poor,0,26185746,2,,poor,2,MATH347,"Prof. Wyser is not very good at proof-based math. Porf. Wyser don't like to use definition, which make me feel he is not a good mathematician. So, his lecture will not help you to build a math foundation. And I can never understand why a math lecturer emphasis so much on attendance.",03/26/2016,1,1.0,,1,N/A,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people

N/A,good,poor,average,0,21722463,1,,good,5,MATH348,"His lectures are awesome. Sometimes he looks like he is angry but he is not. He is just tired (maybe not, but he doens't hate you!). He cannot be a mean person because he has three daughters. Also, he is very very smart and the grading is not harsh. He is teaching next fall so I recommend this class. p.s. I think he is nice.",05/09/2013,1,1.0,,2,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

N/A,good,average,average,0,21377400,1,,good,5,MATH348,"Overall he is a very intelligent man, and he does do an excellent job giving lectures in class, as they are easy to follow. He writes legibly and stays consistent in notation. The class difficulty and workload is manageable. The big problem, though, is he does send vibes that he doesn't want to teach. In office hours, he gets very annoyed quickly.",03/01/2013,3,3.0,,2,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
