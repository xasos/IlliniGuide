N/A,good,average,average,0,20333059,0,,good,4,RHET102,Ms. Weber was a good Rhet Professor in my opinion. Although there were times where I couldn't stand her. She canceled class often but in returned was Bad! Every time she missed a class she would add assignments which was STUPID! but she graded fairly.

However, I wouldn't say that if you just show up to class you are fine. You have to write an 8-10 page persuasive paper. Along with  smaller papers and assignments that go with the research paper.
