N/A,good,poor,good,0,18282450,0,,good,5,CW104,"John is a great professor.  I had him for CW 104, which is the Intro to Narrative Writing in the creative writing program.  Not only are the class discussions interesting, but he always makes time during his office hours for students.  The workshop style format of the class works really well--it allowed me to get more comfortable in my own writing.",03/16/2011,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Jon was very entertaining - he had great comments and great instruction - obviously knew what he was talking about. He maintained a professional, productive, and enjoyable atmosphere for the students. Easy class and you learn a lot!",03/02/2006,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
