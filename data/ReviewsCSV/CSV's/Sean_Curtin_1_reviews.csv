Gives TONS of extra credit opportunities and also answers questions during testsquizzes, as long as the questions are in French. Overall, very easy teacher and straight to the point. Really makes you understand French linguistically. ",04/23/2015,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

I learned more than I did in LAN 111.12, and I thought he structured the class well. Be prepared for lectures to be taught mostly in French. I thought he was kind of intimidating (initially) and a little rude at times, but he's got a sense of humor. ",04/06/2015,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

He allowed questions to be asked during tests and quizzes as long as the questions were in French. He gave homework every night, but it was online and super easy.
