N/A,good,average,good,0,18818516,0,,good,5,CMN101,Natalie was a fantastic teacher for CMN 101! She teaches the class extremely well and makes it quite entertaining. She also had a quick wit and a great sense of humor. She also uses games to teach the points as opposed to just lecturing. If you have to take CMN 101 I suggest taking it with Natalie for the best experience,07/14/2011,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
