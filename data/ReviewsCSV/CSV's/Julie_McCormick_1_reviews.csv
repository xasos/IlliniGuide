Her descriptions of assignments are vague; sometimes it seems as though even she does not know what she expects. She grades papers somewhat harshly. However, her optimistic personality does keep class discussions light and pseudo-enjoyable.",10/30/2011,2,2.0,,2,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
