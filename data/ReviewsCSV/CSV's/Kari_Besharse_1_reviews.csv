She seemed very happy to be teaching us and got excited over dorky things like Neapolitan chords. I crushed pretty hard over her that semester.

She isn't delusional and understands that music theory can get pretty difficult so she's always eager to help and genuwinely wants her students to do well and understand the material. Gives full credit on weekly homework even if you got every problem wrong, as long as it's complete. =)",08/23/2008,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
