N/A,good,average,good,0,15105155,0,,good,4,ACCY304,Only one test and it is open book open note.  Only one project and you get the whole semester to do it.  Almost no homework assignments and everything is done in class.  He hasn't quite caught on to technology yet so make sure you have a 3-ring binder and keep all the handouts he gives you well organized.
