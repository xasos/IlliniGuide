N/A,good,good,good,0,18045242,0,,good,4,ANTH230,"In retrospect, the topic is very interesting. The tests and papers were a challenge because they were application questions. Well structured and fairly graded. She will compromise with the class. Be sure to use key words in papers and READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS because the papers have multiple parts, and you don't want to miss one.",12/26/2010,5,5.0,,4,Meh,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I really despised this class, but i'm not interested in anthropology so maybe it would be a little more interesting for others. WAY too much reading that you have to do and is very boring. Definitely wouldn't take it as a blowoff class",06/02/2010,4,4.0,,3,Low,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I cannot stand this woman. Class was boring, many students fell asleep, she likes listening to her own voice, avoid her classes.",05/27/2010,3,3.0,,1,Low,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,17207940,0,,good,4,ANTH230,Very interesting class. She is very laid back and is very passionate about the topics. But the class is somewhat unorganized. She added more work to the syllabus a month into the course and didn't show up for class a couple times(with no warning). A lot of people really got pissed in April when they got their first papers back (see below).,05/15/2010,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,17032077,0,,poor,2,ANTH230,"She seems to have unrealistic expectations. She assigns ridiculous amounts of readings and homework. She grades down all the time for not &quot;critically analyzing&quot; instead of just summarizing material, even when students do more than just summarize. She just doesn't communicate well about what she wants from her students.",04/21/2010,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,average,0,17026993,0,,poor,1,ANTH103,"She is just a bad teacher - you can tell she is passionate but she is incoherent, makes up words and is somewhat unrealistic in her expectations of a larger class.  The subject was interesting - I liked the readings - but she was boring, and annoying... I felt kind of bad for her, no one really liked her in my class.",04/20/2010,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,good,good,0,16945126,0,,good,5,ANTH230,"She seems like a nice person and knows the material well, but I would not recommend taking her class. She constantly insists that we &quot;make the connections&quot; and think about theory, but then gives picky multiple choice/true false exams. The reading load is heavy and difficult. The readings are educational, but Shoaff cannot discuss them engagingly.",04/03/2010,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
