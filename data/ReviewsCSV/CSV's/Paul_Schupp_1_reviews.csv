N/A,average,poor,poor,0,14047685,0,,poor,2,MATH415,He didn't show up for the very first class. Shows up the next class - I realized why he didn't show the first time - he is freakin' ancient! He didn't show because he couldn't get out of bed! This guy is in his 60's! So the next week he didn't show up again. By then we've officially had 4 classes and a no show for 2:4. We then got a new professor,01/27/2008,1,1.0,,1,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Many ppl didnt understand his lectures since they were stating theorems and definitions but if you know your math its an easy A.

Made fun of his class for doing poorly on an exam. Gave few examples from problems in the book and talked mostly about the theory behind the concepts, which made little sense until discussion when students saw examples.",02/13/2007,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Theorems had to be memorized word for word, but if you did that there was little to prove on exams. Homework was done in groups and was fairly difficult w/ little relation to the exams.
