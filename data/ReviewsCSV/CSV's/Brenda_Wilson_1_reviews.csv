If you put in the effort she expects of you, you will do well. However, her classes are difficult. You have to work for your grade.

Its a shame, because I may have enjoyed the class if it was not so difficult. The only thing that is good about the class is the curve. As for Wilson, all she does is reads off slides.",05/07/2013,5,5.0,,2,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
