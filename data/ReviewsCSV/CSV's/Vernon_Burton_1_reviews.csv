Also, its best to take the class with a friend cause it makes going to lecture not as bad (you really don't need to go...). The final was 30 something matching questions which he gave you. 3 papers which were graded really easily in my opinion.",04/20/2006,2,2.0,,2,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
