The class itself it pretty easy--just go to class and do the stupid assignments and you'll be fine. But she is so unpleasant that it makes the course hard to deal with. She's also a nightmare in terms of clarity--always make sure to ask her to clarify due dates and assignment instructions. ",11/12/2014,4,4.0,,3,Meh,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people
