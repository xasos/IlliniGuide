Not Mandatory,average,good,average,0,25569783,0,,average,2,ME300,"I think she genuinely wants people to learn.  The wording on her exams make the problems difficult to understand. Conceptually, I understand thermodynamics better because of her. I also get anxiety over my grade now. Also, to the previous comment: the tests are curved, so if you're getting an ""F"", that means you basically can't do thermo.",12/07/2015,5,5.0,,3,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,B-,,people,people

However, her quizzes and exams completely blindside you. She does not give you preparation material and you get no sympathy if you or the entire class performs poorly. Try to avoid this professor.

N/A,good,good,good,2,24096042,0,,good,4,ME300,She's brand new. When she first came in you could tell that she put a lot of time trying to optimize the class so you learn as much as possible. As you can see that doesn't work for everyone. She is not menacing or bad at teaching. Her material was a bit unorganized (like any 1st ed). My only concern is the work load for exams is a bit large. ,12/16/2014,4,4.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
