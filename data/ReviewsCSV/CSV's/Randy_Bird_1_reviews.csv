His quizzes are ridiculous, his demeanor is questionable. The tests were long. If you plan on keeping him as your prof, prepare for an excruciating time. He is not very good.",08/18/2009,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I learned much more from studying the book. Too praticular-- took a point of an assignment for not stapling it!",05/08/2006,4,4.0,,3,It's my life,3,3.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
