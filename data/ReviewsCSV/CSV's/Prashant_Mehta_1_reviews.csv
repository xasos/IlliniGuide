Mandatory,average,good,average,0,24827784,0,,average,2,ME360,Assigns a terrible textbook. Does not post lecture notes. Does not post practice exams. Exams are convoluted versions of HW questions. His lectures are straight out of the (terrible) textbook.  The HW solutions posted are atrocious with the same solution having different nomenclature used in different problems with superficial solutions-no details ,05/14/2015,5,5.0,,3,Low,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,19617155,0,,poor,1,TAM541,I felt like he doesnt know the content he is teaching in this class. He made the exams very very long. And graded whimsically. I will never take a class with him. I am very much disappointed with his class,12/24/2011,5,5.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,16965402,0,,good,4,ME360,"He is a pretty nice guy and wants people to learn.  His homework is worth 30% and you'll have 3 tests before the final worth about 10% each. The tests are heavily based on HW and his past exams, which personally I think is best, though you might have HW due the week of exam with material on the exam.",04/08/2010,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,3,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
