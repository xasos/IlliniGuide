Warning: For the final project, although it doesn't say explicitly, add a scan of your mid semester report to your final paper otherwise you will get many points off and make sure it looks 'pretty'.",01/12/2016,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

It kinda sucked when she would get confused over material from time to time when students asked her questions. She gives good opportunities to get points back (EC, exams) but she DOES NOT give partial credit. Also, if you hate group projects, run.

I do think this class is the best preparation homework and expectation-wise for the rest of engineering classes.
