Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25843359,0,,good,5,KIN459,Professor Ken is pretty funny. He tries his best to get his point through. You don't have to attend class but I highly suggest it. His exams are all essays and no book is required but you need  to read academic journals. The journals are helpful for the exam. The lectures are long to emphasize the effects of exercise.,12/29/2015,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

There are three non-cumulative essay-based exams that were tough, but doable if you studied and went to class. Class was not mandatory but necessary if you want a good grade. He was a little scatter-brained sometimes but kept everything concise and to the point!",11/11/2015,2,2.0,,4,It's my life,3.5,3.5,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people
