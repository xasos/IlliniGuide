There was a final project required, but it did not require a substantial amount of work to get an A in this class at ALL.  Half the classes are canceled because of the project, and all of the papers besides the project are 1 page typed.",01/19/2009,1,1.0,,5,Meh,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
