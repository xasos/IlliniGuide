N/A,good,average,good,2,17757613,1,,good,5,RHET105,Possibly the hottest teacher I've ever had. Not only that but he was damn good at his job. I absolutely adore this man. He gets very into the class and the readings and is incredibly intelligent. I had a lot of interesting conversations with him and he taught me a lot.

The course consists of two papers, a midterm, a final, and weekly quizzes over the movie of the week. It's nothing unmanageable, I didn't do much and somehow ended up with an A-.",01/25/2010,2,2.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
