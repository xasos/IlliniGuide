Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,22533129,0,,good,5,PSYCH100,"I loved her. She's happy and energetic which helps at 8 AMs. She brings snacks to every exam, and candy canes to exam reviews. She cares so much about her students and the material and will do just about anything to help.

Makes Psych super interesting, not a hard grader at all, brings in cookies for the exams, no final, and is the nicest professor I have ever had! Definitely take this class for your James Scholar requirement!!",04/24/2012,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,17110949,0,,good,4,PSYCH199,Does not seem like a college professor at all. Laughably easy exams and extremely easy material to cover. Brings in cookies and granola bars for the class when we took a test. Takes somewhat interesting psych. concepts and makes them dull.,05/03/2010,1,1.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,14162321,0,,good,5,PSYC100,The reason why some people don't have her is because she only teaches the James Scholar section. She is the most fair teacher ever. You get 3 exams and you can drop your lowest one. She lets you explain why you thought a certain answer was right and she'll give you the points. She is the nicest teacher ever ad really wants to get to know us!,03/13/2008,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
