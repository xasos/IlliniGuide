He will provide you with interesting history and facts about the quantum physics and relativity. I like this course. Don't be panic if the quantum thing confuse you, and to talk with Professor Weissman is definitely helpful.",05/02/2014,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,15130559,0,,good,4,PHYS419,"This class was very low-key, interesting, and not that much work.  Prof. Weissman's lectures are pretty good, although I'll admit it was easy to zone out at times.  He's all about discussion, so if someone has a question, he'll spend as long as it takes to talk it out.  Pretty good, overall.",12/08/2008,1,1.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
