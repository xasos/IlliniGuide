If you thought tea ceremony was just &quot;sitting on bamboo and drinking tea&quot; you obviously didn't get the point of the course. Although she does give kind of strange lectures, I found it to be an interesting and enlightening class. Thanks--",11/14/2005,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
