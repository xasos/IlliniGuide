The three papers are easy to write (wrote them all a day before their deadlines) and studying for the midterm and final were easy. she literally told you everything you needed to know.

We use i-clickers every class so attendance is pretty much mandatory. Its hard to keep up with some of the material because there's so much. There are 2 writing assignments(2-3 pages), 1 paper (5-7 pages) and 2 exams. She grades pretty easy on the papers. Don't bother buying the text",12/16/2013,3,3.0,,3,Meh,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,B,,person,people

However she is a super dry lecturer and sometimes it is hard to understand what she is saying. As long as you pay attention in class and take good notes, you don't really ever need to use the textbook. She curves the tests a lot, and you regularly use iclickers so be prepared for that too",01/14/2013,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
