When I got Mike (DON'T call him Prof, because he will correct you every time.  He prefers Mike or Mr. Howie.), I didn't have much hope.  However, he helped me so much, was willing to talk to me and listened.  Great advice, amazing patience, and incredibly easy to get a hold of.",08/18/2011,3,3.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
