N/A,good,average,good,0,12389931,0,,good,4,EALC250,"The lectures seemed coherent and interesting to me. The problem with the class seems to lie in the fact that a good portion of your grade lies in the class participation and the two midterms, which seem to have be graded by whichever TA you had, so if you get a bad TA the difficulty of the class raises significantly.",11/09/2006,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,12338267,0,,good,5,EALC250,"I thought that this class was really fun, actually. Prof. Konishi is incredibly learned and makes learning about a rather dull subjects very interesting. The reading was very light, and much of the learning and exams was from class (he gave us the questions ahead of time). The only unenjoyable part of the class was discussion with my horrible TA.",10/31/2006,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

We skimmed through East Asian history really superficially, even for a survey class. Even though the prof speaks English (and other languages) fluently, most of the time I had no idea what the heck his point was.",02/13/2006,1,1.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
