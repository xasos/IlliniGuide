Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25310691,0,,good,4,GER121,Frau Suvak is sweet and helpful without being an easy-A professor. She understands our limitations and does her best to make us go through it. Her classes are fun and light. You don't feel the 50 minutes passing.,10/29/2015,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
Mandatory,average,average,average,0,22247723,0,,average,2,GER261,The class itself is pretty easy and straightforward however the professor is a bit of a dud. She flies through her power point without giving much time to take notes and refuses to post any notes online. Also attendance is required and she is extremely uptight about it.Don't miss more than 2 classes otherwise you automatically lose an entire grade.,11/03/2013,3,3.0,,3,It's my life,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people
