He's not an easy to please guy, and he'll make you rewrite assignments, but I feel like I've learned valuable writing tips in this class. Brian is so passionate about his job and is very helpful - he will spend a lot of time and energy to write constructive criticisms on your assignments. He's a personable, intelligent instructor!",07/09/2008,2,2.0,,5,Meh,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He structures it like a workshop and allows you to get feedback and hear your work critiqued aloud during the class- HW is reading other people's stories, writing paragraph reviews, and three 10-15pg stories. Loved it!",12/19/2007,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
