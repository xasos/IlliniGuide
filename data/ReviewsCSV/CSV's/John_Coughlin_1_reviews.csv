Prof Caughlin is a great teacher!  He makes this class interesting to everyone, not just majors.  He tells a lot of funny stories and makes the topics relevant to every day life.  Attend all the lectures and take good notes!!!",10/21/2008,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

There isn't even a book, just online readings, but that also means you MUST go to lecture.",12/12/2006,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
