Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,25665397,0,,good,5,ENGL300,"I love Professor Jenkins. Her enthusiasm to read each book with the students (regardless of how many times she has taught the class) helps to improve the engagement in the course. While there were many books assigned (6-8), they were fun and humorous and relatable. Professor Jenkins is easy to approach and incredibly fun.
