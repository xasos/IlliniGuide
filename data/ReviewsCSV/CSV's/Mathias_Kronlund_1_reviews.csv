If you have a question, he'll give you an answer, not a textbook answer, a well thought out, real-world answer. He is from FIN-land which is where I presume he obtained his interest in FIN-ance. Take him and you will learn a lot and get a good grade. Case closed.",05/07/2014,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A+,,people,people
