You can see his passion and love for what he does. Class is 4 essays of 1000-1400 words. Pretty simple, did them all the day before or day of.

Class had 4 papers, and the first 3 had rough drafts so it wasn't hard to get a good grade as long as you tried for the draft. Class has required reading, but can get by not doing it all. Amazing class, it's obvious he loves philosophy.",12/02/2015,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
