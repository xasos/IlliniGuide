N/A,good,poor,good,0,15669159,0,,good,5,BTW250,Ellen's class was real lax and I enjoyed it. She is real down to earth and helpful.

If you do the readings, participate in class, have a love of literature and go into office hours occasionally there is no doubt that you will get an A.

N/A,good,average,good,0,3936389,0,,good,4,WS250,"TA always comes to class prepared.  She's really funny, engaging, and stylish.  I'm a minor in women's studies, so I had to take this class even though it's an intro course.  But Ellen made the readings really interesting and a lot more understandable than the professor. PLUS she and her girlfriend Joan, another TA, are so cute in lecture!",05/28/2005,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
