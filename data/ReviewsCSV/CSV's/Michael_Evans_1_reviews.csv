This school  is going to lose an amazing professor. Glad I had the chance to be taught by him. Made me love and appreciate orgo even more. Wish him the best of luck at Georgia Tech.",05/06/2013,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,good,good,0,21628328,0,online,good,5,CHEM332,There are too many things to say about Professor Mike Evans. He is good at teaching and good looking. He is helpful and welcomes questions. This class makes Chem 232 look easy. The exam questions are  more difficult but at least students will actually learn something in this class.,04/29/2013,4,4.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,20325151,0,,good,5,CHEM332,"332 was easier than 232. Although it was challenging, I enjoyed the course. The grading scale was very generous & had a semester long project that helped boost the grades. Mike was great at leading discussions, answering questions quickly, & was more than happy to meet with students. He did a lot more than the 232 instructors. Highly recommend him!",05/21/2012,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,good,good,0,19547932,0,,good,4,CHEM332,"Challenging course but slightly easier than CHEM232. Mike Evans is surprisingly good for a graduate student, and I found his sections particularly helpful for exam preparation. Class is essentially a continuation of orgo I and is very mechanism heavy. No curves but some chances for extra credit and a generous grading scale: 85%+ = A, 80-84.9% = A-.",12/17/2011,4,4.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
