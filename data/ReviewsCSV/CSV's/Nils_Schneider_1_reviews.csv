The only problem is that he has a German accent, so if you're not good with accents, he might be hard to understand. However, I had no problem with his accent.",11/10/2009,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He is European, and while his accent was relatively easy to understand, he would often have to ask us how to say a word in English. He reads straight off of a powerpoint he didn't make, and isn't exactly a brillant psycologist. That being said, class was super easy. Not hard at all, just read the study guide",08/24/2009,2,2.0,,1,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
