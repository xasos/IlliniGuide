If you read the book, which you will half to do, going to class is useless. He focuses entirely on the Reformation and Ancient Greece and fly's throw or skips everything in between. The Class itself is also very dry.",06/14/2009,3,3.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Unfortunately, one dealt mostly with his TA's, who were less than effective, some of the time.  However, if you managed to talk to him outside of his lectures, which were actually pretty good for being so huge, you would definitely get your questions answered fully, and with a smile",09/12/2006,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
