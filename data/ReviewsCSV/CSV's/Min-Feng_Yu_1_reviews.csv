N/A,poor,good,poor,1,18774674,0,,poor,1,ME300,One of the absolute worst teachers I ever had. You can hardly tell what he says or writes (and he only writes his overhead notes). His tests were impossible. He never put the final exam grade online so I have no idea how he calculated the final grade and he won't answer my emails or calls... so yea.. avoid this man like the plague,06/28/2011,5,5.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
N/A,good,average,good,0,18643276,0,,good,4,ME300,"Tough call.  He explains well, and goes over all the material clearly.  Exams are only 2 questions (including final) so you could end up getting screwed, or you could do very well. Material is pretty basic, so his &quot;meh&quot; teaching skills were muffled. Focus on the notes and HW's.  Personally, he's a great guy!  Very fair grader!",05/21/2011,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

While his lectures/slides are crystal clear, very few students felt the need to go especially w/ the solutions being available. A very &quot;good&quot; fellow and despite our lack of interest, continued to care about us. Also, his tests are fairly straightforward, and only 2-3 problems.

N/A,average,good,average,0,15827256,0,,poor,2,ME300,Not recommended whatsoever.  Tests are nothing like hw. Spends most of class telling you how to study instead of the material. Uses word files for examples instead of a chalkboard/whiteboard.  One of our tests had an even dist. of grades from 10 to 90%.  Had no TAs.
