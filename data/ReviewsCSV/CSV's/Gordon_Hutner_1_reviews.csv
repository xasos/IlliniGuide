N/A,poor,good,poor,0,21089519,0,,poor,1,ENGL462,"Nightmare. The book list was pretty interesting, but god forbid if you don't like one of them. He loves to hear himself talk but doesn't make coherent points. His prompts are convoluted. He tends to railroad any discussion into what he wants you to say.

N/A,average,good,average,0,20699281,0,,poor,2,ENGL642,"He's very intimidating. Definitely opinionated. The class is supposed to be discussion-based, but he cuts you off often. The guy is obviously smart, but he makes sure you know it. Don't tell him you dislike the books, because he'll go on a tangent about how you're wrong. Not a terrible class, but if you can avoid it, do. Great book list, though.",10/13/2012,4,4.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Opinionated,multi-dimensional man who always makes time to help his students out. Reading load is heavy, but only asks of 2 E-responses per book. 2 essays and a few short analysis here and there. Go to class. Do your work. You'll do just fine.",04/08/2011,4,4.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,average,poor,0,17743123,0,,poor,2,ENGL452,"Professor Hutner loves to hear himself talk. He says things that sound intellectual but rarely have much meaningful substance.  He does not like to be challenged and tends to respond to student comments/questions by using them to launch into his own ideas.  I found the reading load heavy, and the discussions discouraged me from staying involved",11/08/2010,3,3.0,,1,It's my life,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,poor,good,poor,0,3771878,0,,poor,1,ENGL452,"Hutner is a dick. He gives one set of directions then changes his mind and makes you redo the damn assignment. Does not listen to anyoen who has a different opinion than his own- either agree or shut up. Teachers at a grad school level, always confuses his students. Try to avoid his class if you can",05/03/2005,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
