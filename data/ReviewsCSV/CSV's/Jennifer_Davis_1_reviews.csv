She really knows her stuff and seems to really care about how students do in the class. Do the readings or the exams will be a LOT of work. This class should be required for all students at UIUC.",12/13/2015,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

She is understanding and really cares about her students. No exams, just 6 reading responses on the books we read and a final research paper on a topic you choose that has to do with the course. I have yet to actually read a book though. ",03/11/2015,2,2.0,,5,Meh,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

The professor is also very willing to help during office hours if you don't understand something. By far one of the best classes for an Non-WesternUS Minority Cultures Credit at UIUC.",02/05/2015,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
