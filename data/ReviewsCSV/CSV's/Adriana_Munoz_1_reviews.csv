N/A,good,poor,good,0,20521691,0,,good,4,LING210,Class was super easy. She gave you 1000 chances to turn stuff in. Helped you if you were stuck or simply too lazy to figure it out. Had open book midterms and pop quizzes (no finals). The pop quizzes were the only challenging part of the course but only because they were timed. Her clarity is 4 only because she has a slight accent.,07/27/2012,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
