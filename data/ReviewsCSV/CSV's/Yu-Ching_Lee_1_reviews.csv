N/A,average,average,average,0,24788036,0,,average,3,IE330IE430,"She's kind of a disaster in terms of running a course. Usually doesn't do more than read off her slides, which are very detailed (and posted online) so attendance feels not optional. BUT exactly five lectures count for attendance credit, so if you miss one of them you lose 1% of your total grade. So show up, but don't bother paying attention.

Not Mandatory,poor,average,poor,1,22973730,3,,poor,1,IE430AND330,The absolute worst professor I've ever had at U of I. She literally reads off the lecture slides and sometimes confuses herself with her own notes. Going to class is useless unless there's in in class assignment (counts for attendance). Always shows up late to class and her exam seating protocol is time consuming and pointless. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,04/01/2014,3,3.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

The assignment is so long and difficult as hell. I can assure you that you won't learn a damn thing from her class. If it is a mandatory course for you, then I feel so sorry for you. If it is not, then change your schedule!",02/15/2014,4,4.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
