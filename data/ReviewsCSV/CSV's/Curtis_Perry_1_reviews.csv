N/A,average,good,poor,0,20725486,0,,poor,2,ENGL209,"Overall, I've had great experiences with the English staff at UIUC, but the head of the department really let me down. His exams were impossible because of the term section, which no amount of studying could help. His lectures were horrible, very confusing and did not help you understand the texts at all. Very rude and took himself too seriously.",10/22/2012,4,4.0,,1,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Captivating speaker, knows everything- not just Shakespeare but Renaissance Drama in general. If you need someone to write a letter of recc for grad school, having the head of the department isn't so bad",05/22/2010,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

While lecture attendance isn't mandatory, it does help a lot with understanding the material. Perry makes quirky jokes, but helps get the point across.",03/16/2009,4,4.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,14545403,0,,good,5,ENGL209,"The Best Lecturer i've ever heard. Wants to get to know all of his students. Very clear, very funny, very casual in his lectures. Great powerpoints and incredibly honest and humble. Class has tough materials but you dont even need to read if you consistently attend lecture and pay attention. Great person with a passion for English Literature.",06/01/2008,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
