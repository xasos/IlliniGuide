N/A,good,poor,good,0,19598527,0,,good,5,AAS402,"AAS 420 with Pak will be one of the best choice you ever made. Her class is very easy, with no exam, although the reading are a lot, but you only need to skim it and write a 4 page paper on it. There are also no final exam with only a final paper, where you can choice what you want to write on. Because she is a very easy grader.",12/21/2011,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,poor,good,0,19511709,0,,good,5,AAS402,"AWESOME. She is really funny & engages in interesting class conversation if people are willing to participate. NO BOOK- just articles she puts online for you. NO Test, a total of 4 journal responses & one research paper. Class was light load & only once a week. Paul is a really helpful & nice TA as well. Highly recommended, interesting and  easy.",12/14/2011,1,1.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,18296654,1,,good,4,AAS402,"Was pretty helpful. The class was basically a 1-2 pg journal every week and a 10-12 pg research paper due at the endish of the course. Going to class for attendance points is up to you. The material itself is somewhat interesting, but a bit boring at times. Concentrate on the paper and you'll do fine.",03/21/2011,3,3.0,,5,Meh,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

N/A,average,poor,good,0,12725776,0,,good,3,EPS590,"She is extremely funny.  She keeps the classroom stress free and definitely tries to help you with your research.  However, the laidbackness can be construed as her not really caring or a lack of organization but she helps in acheiving the end goal, a nice piece of working research.",01/05/2007,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,4,4.0,3,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
