Even though I didn't get an A in the class, I still learned a lot and wish he could teach me again.

This was by far my favorite course so far in college, probably because Eugene was so amazing as a teacher. Very good-looking too! Take a class with him!

He is great eye candy, and has an awesome sense of humor, so this class was pretty fun, and he was really cool about letting class out early sometimes and giving out treats...even though he was quite a treat himself...:) haha awesome teacher!",12/09/2005,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

My only complaint is that sometimes the quiz questions were a little opaque, but I suppose that's just psychology for you.",01/18/2005,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
