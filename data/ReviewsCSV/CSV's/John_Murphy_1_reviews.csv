As others have stated, there is more emphasis on the history.  Very misleading class title.  Ten points off for each class missed/late 10 min.

Grades so tough on papers and tests suck. Worth 100 points but only 25 questions? Setting you up to fail. Don't take this course.,05/12/2016,5,5.0,,3,N/A,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
