This teacher does not care about her students, or making the class remotely interesting. Very dry. There were not very high expectations for the labs or the final design project. Do not take this class unless you need another class to fall asleep in.",05/22/2013,3,3.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,poor,average,0,21206747,0,,average,3,PSYC358,While everything about the class and professor listed below is slightly true. This class is not very hard. The textbook is only used for five assignments. Lectures are pretty boring and so are the labs. You should get 100% on everything in this class (including the final project) and then there are two exams.  Study and you will be above average.,01/04/2013,1,1.0,,3,It's my life,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

How can we start another presentation that is at least 10 minutes long with only 1 minute left in class?!Next year can you teach the class in a different room. It's too hot! and I like to sit in 700 dollar chairs not the ones in this room. Don't You?,12/05/2012,4,4.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

 Reads off lecture slides and is surprised by the next slide that comes up (as if she didnâ€™t prepare for class.
 I watch more YouTube videos in this class than at home.

Masooda will give you the toughest exams (avg for first exam=62%), read off the slides, and make you sit in an 85 degree classroom (literally).

N/A,average,good,poor,0,20754915,0,,poor,2,PSYC358,Welcome to the worst class in your educational career. This lady reads off the slides and does nothing more. She makes you take exams in 90 degree rooms and the exams are pretty challenging. A terrible teacher plus a terrible class is grounds for a great time.

N/A,average,good,poor,0,20739301,0,,poor,2,PSYCH358,Literally reads off of the lecture slides.  Makes you attend class because of i-clicker points but only gives i-clicker questions half of the time. Complains about students arriving late but arrives late half the time herself.  She made the class take a test when it was 87 degrees in the room (complete opposite of human factors...).,10/25/2012,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
