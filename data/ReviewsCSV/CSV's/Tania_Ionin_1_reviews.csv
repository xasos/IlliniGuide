Not Mandatory,average,good,average,1,24143475,0,,good,3,LING426,"Early morning class, so I only went every now and then. Really boring. Takes attendance, was 5% of the overall grade. Graduate students were required to present their findings on the -many- readings in the class. Be prepared to read a bit. Posts Powerpoints online - most of the material from the tests will be from here. ",12/19/2014,4,4.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,people,person

The powerpoints contain enough; rarely attended and got high A-Bs on the tests. She does include sound files and such in class and asks questions to involve the class. She also seems really nice.",01/11/2011,1,1.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

If you study your power points and notes from discussion section, you will do just fine in this class. 1st test is more difficult than the other 2. Homework and projects are easy grade boosters.",11/07/2007,2,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
