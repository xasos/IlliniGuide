N/A,good,poor,good,0,10681363,0,,good,5,PS309,"Jim is the exact definition of what makes a GREAT professor. The best class ever. There is no book for the class. Class grade is based on three paper which he will give extentions at the drop of a hat. Very funny and welcoming man. Gets to know everyone. Almost every other class has guest speakers, and good ones. HIGHLY RECOMMEND JIM!!",11/02/2005,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
