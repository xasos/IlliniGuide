N/A,average,good,average,0,18000571,0,,average,3,PHYS325,She is not really helpful. The book does a better job at explaining the material then her. The exams are pretty scattered and you won't get a sorta fair exam till the final. Watch where the points come from!! When I took the class she changed the course structure to where the final was 50% and the HW didn't count but you had to pass it.,12/19/2010,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She does not put effort at all in assigning thoughtful homework or preparing for problem sessions. A very kind teacher but not inspiring.",12/24/2008,3,3.0,,1,Meh,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Prof. Lamb is not my favorite as a teacher, although she's very nice.  However, I think she's better than a lot of people give her credit for.  A good TA is a must for this class, though.  Lectures were semi-useful... could have used more explanation.",12/08/2008,4,4.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,average,average,0,12384969,0,,average,2,PHYS325,"Awful lecturer. Our class was behind the course schedule after the first day. She had to remove some course content to 'catch up' to where we were supposed to be. She tends to make a lot of mistakes while deriving things on the board [which i practically all that happens in lectures] and as implied before, moves awfully slow.",11/09/2006,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
