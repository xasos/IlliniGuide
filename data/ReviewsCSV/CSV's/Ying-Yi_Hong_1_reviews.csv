N/A,good,poor,average,0,14677646,0,,good,4,PSYC373,An easy A.  Very easy teacher but a little repetitive in lectures.  There are a few simple points that get drilled in your head but I didn't really learn a lot about culture.  She is so cute though.  I get the same feeling looking at her as I do a stuffed animal or a puppy.  She is always smiling and very nice.,07/22/2008,1,1.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,average,average,0,14485877,0,,average,3,PSYC201,"In this class we never saw her, we were just taught by TAs. The TAs give biweekly quizzes that they write and the professor writes the midterm and final. The material isnt that hard but you still either have to come to class or read the text to do well. Her midterm was easy but the final was tougher bc it referenced specific examples from the book",05/17/2008,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,14424099,0,,good,5,PSYC373,"Easy class. Her powerpoints are all you need. The lectures are basically explaning the powerpoints, so you don't really need to go. She gives plenty of extra credit too. Class content is interesting stuff- not too bad. I would take it just to get the A.",05/07/2008,1,1.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,12249011,0,,poor,1,PSYC250,"Near to unintelligble. Very difficult to follow and the course materials were not very well organized. Never before have I had a class where every time I went I had the strong urge to get up walk out. Many, many others actually did so every single class. I did not enjoy her section at all, and hope the next section of this class will be better.",09/25/2006,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,average,poor,0,10901344,0,,poor,1,PSYC250,She has a very thick accent and is very difficult to understand.  She is not very receptive to questions and will not listen if you try to question about a test score.  Your best bet is to teach yourself the material based off her slides.,11/14/2005,3,3.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
