Not Mandatory,good,poor,average,3,23866109,16,,good,4,CS125,"Chapman himself was an excellent professor. I did not pay much attention in the class, due to already knowing the material. However, he presented the information clearly, and made the class engaging. Overall, CS125 is an extremely easy course, and if you haven't studied it before, Chapman is great.",11/20/2014,1,1.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
