I took 460, literary editing with her. She always made sure that the selection process for pieces engaged with everyone's voice and opinion. Her organization is excellent, and she is very straightforward.",05/05/2016,2,2.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people

With this particular class, just do the homework and respond, you don't even have to talk really.",05/04/2016,2,2.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,Not sure yet,,people,people

She counts credit if you do the commentary/voting thing, like, even last minute. She made me feel comfortable sharing my opinions on a certain piece, even if majority of the class didn't agree.

She is a stickler so make sure you follow her guidelines correctly to get that A that is easily deserved. very free natured while rules and regulations on papers are what you make on your own just don't plagiarize.

Mandatory,average,good,average,0,24820594,0,,average,3,CW460,"She likes to talk, A LOT. Often times class would drag on because she would over discuss things that the class had nothing else to say on. She's loud, really loud. Cover your ears when she laughs. Also, she apparently doesn't like to hand out ""A's."" Her words, not mine. Which is a bunch of baloney, especially if someone earned it.
