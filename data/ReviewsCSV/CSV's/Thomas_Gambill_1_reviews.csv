Mandatory,average,good,average,0,24895608,0,,average,3,CS101,"CS 101 is generally many people's first CS class ever, and in my opinion, it could be taught more effectively. The attitude I got from Gambill is that ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"". Teaching CS is hard, but it doesn't help when you have a teacher with a bad attitude. Tests are weighted way too heavily and are not curved at all (midterm 2 is 40%)",05/24/2015,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
