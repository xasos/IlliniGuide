Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,2,22898278,0,,poor,1,ACCY511,"He mumbles to himself in class, barely make eye contacts with the students, and literally reads off the slides. Grading is extremely unfair yet he always try to justify it. He also has this condenscending demeanor that's just irritating. The most unhelpful professor I've ever seen in my entire academic career. Avoid him at all cost.",03/10/2014,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He does not engage the class or pay attention to the students at all! Extremely difficult to follow, and absolutely incompetent at teaching. He should quit teaching and stick to research.",02/10/2014,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
