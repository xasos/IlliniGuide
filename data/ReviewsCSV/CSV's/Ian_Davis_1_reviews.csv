N/A,average,good,poor,0,19023228,0,,poor,2,ADV493,This teacher makes absolutely no sense. His tests are hard and the material on them was based off of something he discussed in 20 minutes of one lecture. He assigns &quot;blogs&quot; without clear instructions. Worst of all he uses big words and expects us to already know about things he talks about. Lectures are messy and confusing. My worst class so far!,09/26/2011,4,4.0,,1,Meh,1.5,1.5,3,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
