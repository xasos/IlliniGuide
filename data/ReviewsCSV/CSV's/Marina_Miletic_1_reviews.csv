If you want good marks, just suck-up and act like you're &quot;really trying&quot;--that's how she decides who deserves what grade. Forget your design: some of the worst designs received the best grades.",04/12/2011,5,5.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

If you put in the time and effort to try, she will put in the time and effort to help you. I have been working for a year now and still appreciate all the skills she taught me; she definitely prepares you for the real world.",08/16/2010,5,5.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I know people in Unit Ops didn't like her much, but for Senior Design, she gives informative lectures and is always there to help(She gave extra help from 6:30-9pm 6 days a week for 3 weeks during one assignment).She's very difficult,but it's senior design!",12/20/2009,5,5.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,3,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,good,good,0,16421813,0,,good,4,CHBE430,Marina Miletic is the best professor I have ever had.  Why such a low rating on easiness&#63;  Because it's a senior level chemical engineering course; it's supposed to be hard.  No professor in my entire education has helped me as much as Dr. Miletic.  I'm thankful every day that she was there to teach me chemical engineering.,11/24/2009,5,5.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,poor,0,16306116,0,,poor,2,CHBE430,The purpose of the class is to prepare students for &quot;the real world&quot; Marina never worked in her life and teaches nothing but how to satisfy HER. It's her way or the highway and her class is very unorganized. Her lectures are a complete waste of time- you learn nothing and her delivery is very awkward.,11/03/2009,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
