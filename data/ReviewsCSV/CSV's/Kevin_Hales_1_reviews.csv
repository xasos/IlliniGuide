I took American History and we were supposed to cover everything up until the Reconstruction, in the 1870's, and we didn't even get to the 1820's. He went many tangents, mostly about football, and we never covered the material we needed to learn. I missed so much and may need to audit it to learn the information.",11/06/2006,1,1.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Having come in in 05(&#63;) as a replacement for a heavy-duty scholar, we in my class were pleasantly suprised to have such a vibrant presence in class who was just as willing to fall off on a tangent as we were.",09/12/2006,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

There are a lot of class discussions and it really makes the time pass quickly. He is a very easy grader,he really knows his subject, and just an all around great guy. If you can even get in the class,do it",12/09/2005,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
