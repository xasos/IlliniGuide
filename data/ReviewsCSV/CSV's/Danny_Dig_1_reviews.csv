N/A,good,good,good,0,24482274,0,,good,4,CS361,This class is tough with the amount of work needed to be accomplished. In the end it's all worth it since you cover a LOT of information and have a MUCH deeper understanding of software development in a professional setting. Lectures were entertaining.

Low morale in classroom since he prevents CS students from using laptops (he does not understand why no one answers).
