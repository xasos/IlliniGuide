Gives out quizzes that are 5% of the final grade, tough if you don't read the books. Tests are easy, spark notes is the only studying required. Nice,but lied when she said she only gives out A's and B's. Apparently an average test grade of an A- equates to a C+ in the class",01/13/2012,2,2.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
