N/A,average,good,average,0,15029716,0,,average,3,FR208,Class started off easy but she started to grade harder. There are no tests just papers and you have to be very analytical. You have to buy the book and attendance is mandatory. I went to every class though because she's very hot.,11/19/2008,5,5.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
