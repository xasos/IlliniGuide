N/A,good,average,good,0,17043880,0,,good,4,SCAN251,"As a professor, Schwink tends to rush through material a lot, and often rambles off topic.  He is very helpful, and does try to see your point of view.  There are very few tests and quizzes in the class, so it is imperative to well on the ones offered.  I would agree the it is harder than needed, but it isn't impossible.  It isn't exciting either.",04/22/2010,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Professor is knowledgeable and lectures interesting, but quizzes, midterm, and the final were all graded extremely hard. If you don't care about your GPA, it's a good class, but otherwise SKIP it.",05/22/2009,5,5.0,,4,Low,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

This is the first class I have actually looked forward to ever, and I would highly recommend taking any of his classes, I'm sure they are all great!
