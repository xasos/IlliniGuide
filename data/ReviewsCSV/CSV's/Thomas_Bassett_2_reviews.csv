He may seem very communist, but the class is easy, and if you get the chance to know him, he is a very nice guy to be around.

Discussion is necessary to go to because of attendance issues and turn-in assignments, but relates little to what is covered in lecture.

You don't need to read the books that is like 2 questions out of 40 on the tests, and most TA's send out summaries before the tests.
