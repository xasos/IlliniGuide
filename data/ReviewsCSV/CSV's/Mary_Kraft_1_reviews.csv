Mandatory,good,good,good,0,25244557,0,,good,5,CHBE594,"Great classes, lots of content but all very well explained. Examples dissected. Weekly homework force studying every week, which is actually good because the material is extensive and can't be learned in a blink of eyes. 1-4 questions worth points every class. Exams are too long for the time lot, so you have to be incredibly sharp to finish it.",10/11/2015,4,4.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Be ready to do a lot of review and put in a lot of time for homework. She does split up tests into  ""quizzes"" every two or three weeks with one final, which is definitely a better system. She also puts everything online if you miss a class or don't understand something.",04/03/2012,4,4.0,,3,Meh,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
