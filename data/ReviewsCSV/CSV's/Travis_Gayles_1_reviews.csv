N/A,good,average,good,0,12304461,0,,good,5,CHLH101,Very good teacher and he's funny too. HW is easy but the tests aren't. The mc on the tests is easy but the short answers are really hard. It's hard to get a B or better on the tests but the hw makes up for it. His only downfall is he graduated from DUKE!!!!!!,10/22/2006,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
