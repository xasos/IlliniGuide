N/A,good,poor,good,0,18040015,0,,good,5,IB106,Stefan was pretty awesome. He's got a nice sense of humor and is really easy-going. He is not a bad choice for a TA at all. Easy grader and pretty helpful when you have questions. IB 106 should be an easy A if yuo do your work. I recommend Stefan.,12/25/2010,1,1.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
