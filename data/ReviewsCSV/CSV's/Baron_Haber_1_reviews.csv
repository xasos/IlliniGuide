N/A,good,average,good,0,19374158,0,,good,4,RHET243,"Baron runs a good class. He is well prepared for discussions and keeps things interesting. He's also extremely nice and willing to look over writing--even if it is not for class. When I took it, we did free writes every day, and it helped my writing immensely. His grading can seem a bit harsh.",12/04/2011,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
