N/A,poor,good,poor,0,18027320,0,,poor,1,MATH347,"This class was challenging.  Factoring in a professor, who may be a nice person in general, but clearly cannot teach or communicate well with students--this was basically a disaster.  Math was literally a foreign language, and everyone I knew had a tough time understanding.  Homework was ridiculous.  I have no idea how I will end up doing.",12/22/2010,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
