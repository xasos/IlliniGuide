In lecture, half of his slides have the wrong informationand ta's are constantly correcting him. How can you teach something you haven't mastered?

If you read the book and make sure you don't lose easy points on HW you will do fine.There's a very fair amount of extra credit.

The tests are straightforward, but he keeps changing his mind on how he wants things. It can be very confusing keeping track of how he wants you to learn things. Overall, fair. He likes the book, but I thought material was easy",04/11/2011,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
