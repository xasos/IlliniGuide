N/A,poor,good,poor,3,24744551,0,,poor,1,PSYC407,"Honestly, consider taking a different statistics sequence. Both professors in the Pysch department are not good. This prof focuses on the most specific details that you don't have time to learn useful techniques. His test take anywhere from 3-5 hours. All my useful techniques in statistics were not learned in this class. I had to teach myself. ",05/05/2015,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,poor,good,average,2,21863321,0,,poor,1,PSYC407,This course had a VERY high workload. Frieder was difficult to approach with questions because he came off as extremely intimidating. His exams were way too long. I would not recommend this class if you are taking other classes with high workload. Frieder forces you to really know the material well. Not an easy course! Study groups are a must.,06/04/2013,5,5.0,,3,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
