Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,22981850,0,,good,5,MCB354,He is a fantastic professor and a really nice guy. Yeah he reads off the slides but the slides make everything really clear. The biggest issue I have is the grading. They are WAY too harsh if the answer even slightly strays from the answer key you lose like half the credit. So yeah thats frustrating but at least he is a good professor.,04/02/2014,5,5.0,,5,Low,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

While he reads straight from the slides in lecture, his exams don't really stray from what's covered on the slides.
