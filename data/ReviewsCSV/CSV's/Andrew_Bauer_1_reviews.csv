Mandatory,good,good,good,0,26147105,0,,good,5,ACCY312,"Prof. Bauer made learning tax accounting way less difficult. Every lecture consisted of practice problems and application questions, so you always understood how to take what you learned in class and apply it. He was always there to answer questions if you didn't understand something. His tests were fair, and based on the examples in class.",03/15/2016,4,4.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Regardless, he makes the class enjoyable and he is very clear in his explanations. He was also very helpful in office hours. Not a class I'd like to take again, but if I had to, I'd take it with Bauer 10 out of 10 times.",06/24/2014,3,3.0,,5,Low,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A-,,people,person

His exams are fairly difficult, but all tax concepts are. You are making the right decision by electing bauer as your professor.",10/30/2012,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
