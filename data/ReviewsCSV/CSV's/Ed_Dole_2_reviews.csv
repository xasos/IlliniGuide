Most of the information you will ever need is on his website and power points, but he does give easy in-class assignments to take attendance. Overall Dole is very helpful and seems like he truly cares about his students (which is rare here).",01/19/2009,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
