N/A,good,average,good,0,21242531,0,,good,5,MAT108,"Very easy going guy who starts out strict at first but turns into one of the most forgiving I've ever had. If you talk to him about your issues you're having, he is highly understanding and will give you a lot of room. He must have improved in recent times for his lectures because he's not bad at all now. He just needs to work on grading on time.",01/10/2013,2,2.0,,5,Low,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,21011174,0,,poor,1,MATH108,Terrible teacher. His tests are extremely difficult and are not in the same format as homework assignments which makes it even more confusing. He also took over a month to get our tests graded and back to the class. I'm not just saying this because I'm some disgruntled student who didn't get a good grade. I am an A student but I ended up with a D!,12/10/2012,5,5.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He forgets his book sometimes and has forgotten twice to make a quiz that he set a date for.. His homework information that he gives isn't like the problems he gives on the quizzes or tests.

Homework problems way too long and did not coincide with examples we did in class. Spent more time working on this class than any other. Ridiculous for a 100 level course.
