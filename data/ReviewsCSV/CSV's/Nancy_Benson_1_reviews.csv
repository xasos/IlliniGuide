I learned so much from her class, and I changed majors only because although I was good at journalism, it helped me see that it was not for me. Overall, she is an excellent journalist and a worthwhile prof.",09/08/2008,4,4.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Benson does not realize that we students have  lives. She expects us to stalk sources, we could get hurt in the process. She doesn't like many students and makes their lives hell. She is also dull and boring. This class sucked and the professor was worse.",11/29/2007,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
