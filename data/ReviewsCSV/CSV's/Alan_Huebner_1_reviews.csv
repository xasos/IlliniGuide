He explains the material very well, and his tests are not out to trick you....all he is trying to do is make sure you know and understand the material. I'd take a stats class by him again in a heartbeat. His grading is very generous, and he tries to help you as best he can.

Alan was especially helpful in office hours, but it wasn't usually necessary because he explained the material pretty well.
