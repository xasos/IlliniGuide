Went to his office for a scheduled meeting before midterms, told me he ""didn't want to waste his time"" if I didn't grasp some of the concepts already. No textbook, and no other professor taught it, so it's not like you could seek help elsewhere.",05/23/2014,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
