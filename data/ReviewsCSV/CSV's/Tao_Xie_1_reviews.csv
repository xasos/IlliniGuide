Professor's lecturing was so boring and sometimes his answers to students' questions were wrong. He seemed not interesting in and responsible for teaching this course. Overall, this course is useless. I would not recommend it at all!",06/06/2015,3,3.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,average,poor,2,24174001,0,,poor,1,CS427,"Not good at lecturing-often spends multiple lectures rambling on about the same topics. Project he has us use for the course is buggy and poorly documented. Slow at getting grades out and final exam format was weird (and included stuff we barely even touched on during lecture). Group project is a nightmare. Class overall wasn't too hard, though.",12/23/2014,3,3.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
