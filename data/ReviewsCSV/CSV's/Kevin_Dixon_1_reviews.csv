N/A,good,average,good,0,14986857,0,,good,5,IB150,"Kevin Dixon is a great teacher. He explains things very well, uses great examples, and clearly loves the subject he teaches. He is by far the most helpful teacher I have met and truly cares about all of his students. If you don't understand the material, go to office hours. He is always welcoming.",11/13/2008,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

His stutter can get in the way at times, but he keeps it well under control, and it isn't even evident in one on one situations. His exam questions are somewhat difficult, but nothing that studying can't help.",02/13/2007,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

His test questions are far too difficult for an introductory course and a lot of times don't make a lot of sense.  Very very boring and I slept through most lectures.  He's enthusiastic though, which can be either a good thing or a bad thing depending.",05/09/2006,4,4.0,,3,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
