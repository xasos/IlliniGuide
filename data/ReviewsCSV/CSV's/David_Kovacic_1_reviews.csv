N/A,good,average,average,0,18102480,0,,good,4,LA250,"I really liked Kovacic. He is probably the nicest professor you will ever have, and though his lectures can be dry, he livens them up with an occasional really funny joke. His class was really easy and repetitive, we took the same exam 4 times. Loves Allerton and stomping through the woods.",01/08/2011,2,2.0,,3,Low,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,average,average,0,16140457,0,,good,3,LA250,"I enjoyed David Kovacic as a teacher. I took him for LA 250: Environmental Site Analysis, and I found him to be intelligent, optimistic, fair, and passionate about his work. All I can say negative, is that the class I took was (maybe because of rain delays) unorganized and rarely on schedule. Yes he loves to survey Busse Woods and Allerton",08/21/2009,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
