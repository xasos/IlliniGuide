N/A,good,average,good,0,17279100,0,,good,4,RLST127,"Catholic or not, this course superbly teaches about the Catholic Church and her ways. Dr.Howell is the best professor I have had in college. A true Renaissance man and teacher. Difficult topics are discussed near the end and some have a hard time swallowing facts due to their emotions. Best class to expand your way of thinking altogether.

Be prepared to hear attacks on homosexuality, contraception, evidence for climate change and overpopulation. Dr. Howell is very intelligent, and a great theologian, but his political views are hard to swallow.
