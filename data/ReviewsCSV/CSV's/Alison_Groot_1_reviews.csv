N/A,poor,good,poor,0,14240242,0,,poor,1,PAYC238,Our first quiz covered the first 3 chapters.  the midterm had just one more chapter.  both were very hard.  Before the first quiz she decided to cram in a whole chapters worth of lecture before we took it.  That's why it was so terrible.  Class was totally unprepared.  Acts like a easy teacher but tests like a hard one!,04/03/2008,5,5.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Very unorganized and plans lectures around technology but doesn't know how to use it, i.e. clicker and videos.  Doesn't cover everything in class if she thinks you can understand it by reading. Quizes and tests very hard because she doesn't prepare you well for them.",04/03/2008,5,5.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,poor,poor,poor,0,14060962,0,,poor,1,EPSY220,This has been by far the most useless course I have enrolled in.  I have learned nothing and everything done in class was completely useless.  This teacher has showed up late to all but one class and has yet to be adequately prepared.  I would recommend finding another teacher if you are interested in one of Ali's courses.,01/31/2008,1,1.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
