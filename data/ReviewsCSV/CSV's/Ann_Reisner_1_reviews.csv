She's very passionate about the subject, but kind of has her own opinion about everything. Attendance was worth 3 points per class.

There's a lot of work with analyzing studies, which doesn't seem like it belongs in this class, but again, it isn't difficult. Exams were simple and she gave out a lot of candy.",03/15/2016,1,1.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Not only that but she's very old and teaching about media which didn't really exist much while she grew up. This entire class seems opinionated and half the stuff she teaches is OBVIOUS.

The good thing is everyone will be confused so everyone works together to try and figure out what the teacher is talking about. She is very subjective and goes on crazy tangents.

For SOC 351, you don't really want to miss class because there are graded self-checks and policy statements.  I missed three and it brought my grade down to a B.

N/A,average,poor,good,0,21255226,0,,good,3,MACS351,Super easy course as long as you  go to all of the classes.  A huge percentage of your grade is based off of in class assignments that she she helps you with. Very understanding and an easy A as long as you pay attention. No need to really use the textbook either because she covers it all in her lectures.
