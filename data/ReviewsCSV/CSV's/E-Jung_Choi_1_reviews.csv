Another professor looked it over & she said that it was better than what I received.  When I contested I got no regrade.  I should have had an A, not a B+.  Plus she seems to be afraid of correcting you in class...",01/13/2007,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,3,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The class is at 8:30 in the morning, which doesn't help, and no absences are allowed. If you can help it, don't take this class or at least try to be in a different section",12/09/2006,4,4.0,,2,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
