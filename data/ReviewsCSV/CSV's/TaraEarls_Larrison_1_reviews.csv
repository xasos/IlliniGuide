Not Mandatory,average,average,average,0,26469048,0,,average,3,SOCW200,"Tara did a great job at giving an introduction of the social work profession. The class is really easy. There's just three online exams (one is optional) four papers, and one research project.",05/04/2016,2,2.0,,3,N/A,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
Mandatory,average,average,average,1,24727231,0,,poor,2,SOCW200,"The topic and information was relevant and interesting. However, the TA's help more than Tara. When she was in the classroom, she cut students off when they were talking in discussions. She doesn't answer questions very clearly. I also got the impression that she did not respect her main TA and was often rude to him in front of students.",05/03/2015,3,3.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,person
Mandatory,good,average,average,2,23746011,0,,good,4,SOCW200,"I found her pretty irritating. She calls out and praises the same 10 students in a class of 60 and tries to create a ""life-changing"" experience through her class that just doesn't happen. Lecture is really boring save for videos. The papers are annoying but there are only a few. However, she grades easy enough and the class itself isn't hard.",11/05/2014,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,Not sure yet,,people,people
Mandatory,poor,good,poor,2,23659994,0,,poor,1,SOCW200,"The thing that really bugged me about this class is how slanted it is. It is so one sided and Tara, I found, favored the students who reflected her beliefs. It got so frustrating because of her intolerance (which is ironic, given we've been taught to be tolerant to everyone and everything) of opposing beliefs and avoiding diversity of opinions.",10/15/2014,4,4.0,,2,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,average,3,22564314,0,,average,4,SOCW200,"Tara is a control freak. She DEMANDS that this class is transformative and builds it into the curriculum. If you do not have an amazing experience with her, it will affect your grade. Her class feels 3x as long as it actually is. Don't let her turn you off of social work though if you're taking this class to see if you like the major.",12/15/2013,2,2.0,,2,It's my life,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I've had so far; makes a great effort to know her students and to include them as much as possible in the course material. Easy to get an A if you attend class regularly and keep up with readings.
