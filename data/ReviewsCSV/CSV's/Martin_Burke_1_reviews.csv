Now it is trivial; in 450 you'll learn to memorize basic biochem, in 436 you get taught by one of the best professors at U of I. It is an incredibly difficult course (you will fail most of the tests), but you will dominate orgo (and the curve boosts your grade, lots of B/C's).",12/26/2012,5,5.0,,4,Low,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
