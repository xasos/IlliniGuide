Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24908061,1,,good,4,MATH286,"This is one of my favorite professors I have encountered. His class will be very hard to those who aren't good at math, but very easy for those who are. Classes are sometimes boring, but he will usually throw in jokes about math, himself, and his own teaching. He covers material well but if you don't understand he is always helpful in office hours.",05/27/2015,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,person,people

Not Mandatory,average,good,average,0,24860027,0,,average,2,MATH286,"His lectures are a little confusing and it's hard to pay attention. The exam questions are mostly from the textbook, so study from that. He is most helpful in office hours and he really does try to help you out if you're lost. Also, he didn't ask any physicsword-problems on exams all semester, but he then asked a few on the final exam.

When he hands back exams, there is always a 50% of the class who failed and a 50% of the class who got an A. All questions in the exams are in the book, so use that to study. His lectures are hard to pay attention in. However, he is very open to help.",04/22/2015,4,4.0,,4,Really into it,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person

Exams are 90% of the final grade, and are much more difficult than what previous reviewers had (except midterm 1). The book is not helpful, and it won't prepare you enough for the recent examsnothing will. Some mistakes? RIP gradeGPA.
