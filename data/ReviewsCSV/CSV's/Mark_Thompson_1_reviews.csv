As others noted, he is very set in his interpretation of the texts, but he certainly made me think in a way i never had before. I think i took 4 classes with him total, i so liked his style. He's also hilarious and so helpful. Tests are easy, but if you abuse his kindness, you're rewarded with pop quizzes. Take him!",04/22/2008,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

You'll ace exams by regurgitating his opinions. If you're looking for an instructor who will help you develop your own analytical abilities, look elsewhere, as he seems interested in only his own.",01/07/2005,1,1.0,,1,It's my life,2,2.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
