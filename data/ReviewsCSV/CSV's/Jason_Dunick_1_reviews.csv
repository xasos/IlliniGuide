N/A,good,good,average,1,15902834,0,,good,4,ECON103,"Jason is a decent teacher, his tests are mildly difficult because you really need to know your stuff to answer the questions, but he does give out study guides that are really helpful. His paper prompt are really ambiguous and he grades them very critically, so going to talk to him is something I recommend.

His class is super-straightforward: just read the book, memorize his list of terms perfectly, and then there's no way you can't do well.

He gives a long list of terms that we need to memorize and several different essays. He picks two of them for the test.

However the class is based on very few grades and at any point there is little indication as to what your grade is.
