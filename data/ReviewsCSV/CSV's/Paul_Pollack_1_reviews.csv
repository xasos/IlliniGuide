N/A,good,good,good,0,15235934,0,,good,5,MATH347,Paul was an awesome teacher! I reccomend him especially for 347 because this class is soo difficult but he is very helpful! You have to go to office hours in order to get homework done and tests are very similiar to the reviews.  HARD class but this professor makes it manageable!,12/18/2008,4,4.0,,5,Low,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
