Also, the average for quizzes is 97-100% , and there are plenty of opportunities for easy extra credit. Lastly, this was the most challenging class I have taken, yet Dr. Koerner makes it very relevant, enjoyable and engaging.",05/06/2016,3,3.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,25321189,0,,good,5,CHEM332,Dr. K is very cool and likes telling stories. He will shove A LOT of information at you but it is all pretty clear. It is remembering it all for the test that is the tough part. There are 14 office hours available throughout the week so someone is there to help.
