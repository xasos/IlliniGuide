However, professor Di Girolamo really is a good lecturer and helps you out.  He gives you all the lecture notes, so you don't really miss anything.  The only thing I wish this class had was an online component on Compass or a website.",05/12/2011,4,4.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
