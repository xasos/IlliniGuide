Unless you are really interested in the Jewish Sepharad, this class will not be interesting. He make class really dry and the readings ar3e very long and very hard to read. He gave maybe 2 pop quizzes over the course that I both failed, which didn't end up affecting my grade too much (ended up with A-).",11/15/2013,3,3.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A-,,people,person

The class is super straight forward so you won't really need his help for a lot but simply conversing with him is great. i HIGHLY recommend his class because he's awesome!,07/23/2013,1,1.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

He and his TA Talya don't care about the students, and their quizzes are often unreasonable. The readings are long, boring, useless and painful.
