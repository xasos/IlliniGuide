Compelling, engaging, encourages students to think critically about material in unique ways. I've never wanted to work so hard for a class. Readings are always interesting. Take a class with Onni!",07/20/2014,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

GWS 385 was the best course I've taken at UIUC thus far and it's entirely because Onni is such an outstanding professor. I was inspired every time I came to class and produced some of my best work there. Be mindful, though. If you don't care about social justice, you won't enjoy yourself.",06/26/2014,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people

They are very creative, engaging, and funning. They taught me to better analyze and critique cultural imperialism, a skill each person should be familiar with. Definitely take a class with this prof if you can. Not too hard but very enjoyable",12/10/2013,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
