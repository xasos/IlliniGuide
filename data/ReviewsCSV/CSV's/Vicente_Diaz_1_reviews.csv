He's a nice guy, but class is incredibly long and boring. What he says in the 1.5 hours could be said in 10 minutes. One day we just watched a video of people playing cricket and chanting for 90 minutes. 90 MINUTES",10/20/2014,4,4.0,,4,Meh,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

His tests and papers are easy if you listen to what he says but lectures can be be dry. He is a nice guy with a lot of passion for his lectures but can be very boring.,11/22/2013,2,2.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
