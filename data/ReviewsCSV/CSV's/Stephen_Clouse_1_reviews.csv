Hmm, interesting. Anyway, he is awful. Very disrespectful to a number of students and very unprofessional. Do not take this course with him. Exams were far more difficult than any other intro class I have ever taken.",01/16/2014,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,C,,people,people
Not Mandatory,average,good,poor,0,22618974,0,online,poor,2,ASTR100,DO NOT take this course unless you are VERY interested in Astronomy and want to work VERY hard for an A.  One of the hardest 100 level courses I have taken in 4 years.  Exams were wayyy too hard and had some material we didn't even learn.  Online homeworks and assignments were easy with google.  Exams are the deal-breaker.  Even with studying.,12/19/2013,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,people,people

Mr. Clouse was fairly lenient as I saw him open certain assignments again and again for people who missed it and allowed someone to take the test at the wrong location so that person wouldn't have to run across campus.,12/19/2013,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

The lecture videos were also refreshing, BUT this course was very badly run & the exams were NOT well written at all. The instructor seldom answered our forum questions.

If you are looking for a gen ed that is interesting and you want to know more about, look elsewhere because the course is horribly structured and the exams and the study materials don't correlate in a efficient manner.

N/A,poor,good,poor,0,22596152,0,online,poor,1,ASTR100,Any sort of interest I felt for the topic was absolutely crushed to bits by Clouse. He answers forum questions with an arrogant tone and is impersonal. Exams don't reflect the effort you put in and there's no leniency in grading (for exam 1 only 1 person out of 500 got 100). The guy completely hates his students and wants to see them all fail.,12/18/2013,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

For a 100 level course, Professor Clouse expects 20+ hours of studying for his exams.  The questions are worded very poorly.  For the Course Q & A, he answers questions very ambiguously.
