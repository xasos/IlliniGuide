N/A,good,poor,good,0,24861867,0,,good,5,HDFS105,Jan is one of those lecturers where you can simply listen to (without taking notes) and learn a lot from. HDFS 105 isn't a difficult class at all and I'm sure some students did fine by cramming for an hour before an exam but that doesn't take away from the fact that Jan's lectures are well articulated and manages to keep topics interesting. ,05/18/2015,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,poor,good,0,22095318,0,,good,5,HDFS206,"Jan is a sweetheart, although she tends to talk a lot (which makes class longer than it needs to be). You only meet once a week and the rest of the course is at the CDL/ECDL. There is a short quiz before every class. No final. Very easy class. Although, work with kids from 8 AM-12 each week was not so easy. I'm not a morning person",08/29/2013,1,1.0,,4,Meh,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,21471578,0,,good,5,HDFS105,"I loved Jan! I actually liked going to lecture because she made the subject more interesting. I also had her for my discussion (most people have TAs) so going to discussion was interesting too. She is very lenient when it comes to turning things in late, but the TAs are a little more strict. This is definitely an easy A class.",04/01/2013,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,21010815,0,,good,5,HDFS105,"Jan is energetic and passionate.  This class is EASY.  Connect assignments are tedious, but you can do them over and over again until you get them right.  Go to mandatory discussions, and go to optional review sessions.  If you do go to lectures, find the exam study guides ahead of time on compass and fill them out in class.
