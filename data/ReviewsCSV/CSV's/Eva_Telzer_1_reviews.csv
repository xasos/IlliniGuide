Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24409452,0,,good,5,PSYC320," I didn't find the tests to be anywhere near the difficulty described by the other reviewers, especially since a lot of the questions were either very straightforward. Other criticisms of her clarityare over-exaggerated. Dr. Telzer would mis-speak from time to time (less than once per lecture on avg) but always corrected herself.",02/24/2015,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Her presentation was dry and she stumbled over her speech because she was clearly terrified. Tough grader on the writing with no feedback ever.

It's not like she's foreign either--she's just so nervous and it's pretty obvious. She grades extremely harshly, and writes the exams just to trick students. Material is interesting, but I wish professors had a genuine interest in students' achievement rather than tricking ",12/18/2014,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24065423,1,,good,5,PSYC320,"She's nice. Adolescent development is a good subject. She does expect you to read the assigned readings before class. I suggest doing them on time rather than trying to read them all the night before the exams. 1project, 1 paper, 3 exams and lots of I class activities (participation).
