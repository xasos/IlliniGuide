Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,22277073,0,,good,5,ATMS302,"I LOVE ZHUO. 4 non-cumulative exams and no final. Homeworks are short, assigned Thursdays and due Tuesdays. She gives learning objectives for every exam so basically a study guide. Study those and the exams are a piece of CAKE. I also learned a TON, she is so good at explaining things in terms we can understand. Great class, AWESOME professor!",11/07/2013,2,2.0,,5,Meh,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people

She can be hard to understand sometimes, but she really knows her stuff and will clarify if you ask questions.  We had 5 homeworks and 5 exams (and 6 people in the class). The homework can be hard, but we always reviewed the day before exams, which really helps. She basically tells you exactly what will be on them.",05/08/2012,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
