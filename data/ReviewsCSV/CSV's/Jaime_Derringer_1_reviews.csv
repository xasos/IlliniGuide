Posts slides online, but GO TO LECTURE because there's material she discusses not in the slides that will be on the exam.  Exams are tricky, so use the study guides she gives. I got As and Bs with a decent amount of studying, so it's not too tough. Just not an easy A. Fun class!",10/11/2015,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

This was the pilot of this class and it was well - structured with a midterm, final paper, discussion question submission and attendance points. There's a lot of reading primary lit for behavior genetics but it's worth it. ",05/18/2015,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Easy to listen to because she is very personable. The class is a bit on the tougher side but super interesting, definitely take this class!",10/09/2013,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,B+,,people,people
