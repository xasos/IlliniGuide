N/A,good,average,good,0,22816573,0,,good,4,ANSI100,Very easy to go up to talk to. Understands and addresses any concerns you have. He curves all the tests so thats a plus. There aren't any extra points in the class besides test points but because he curves all of them its no big deal.

N/A,good,average,average,0,18430235,0,,good,4,ANSC100,"The class is much different than most classes. You are taught by a myriad of professors and are really only taught by Parrett for a few sections. All the professors are great. You purchase a DVD for $75 at the beginning of class that substitutes for 2 out of your 3 lectures of the week, so you only go on Mondays and labs rock!
