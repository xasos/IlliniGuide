He is always there for his students and is always willing to help out in class and office hours. He respects all of his students, and gives great feedback. I've become a much better public speaker as a result of his class. I just didn't like how the final was a group project.",05/04/2016,3,3.0,,5,N/A,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

The class, CMN 340, is an interesting class but this incompetent really is a terrible teacher. His personality is awkward and he has got some serious complexes.

This wasn't the first course that I've taken with David, but I liked the way he taught this course way better than the way he taught 112. He's a tough grader, but in the long term it'll definitely help because he gives really constructive feedback.

You have to put forth some effort, but classes are really fun and you actually learn stuff. It's useful too! One thing, he's a tough grader.. but it really helped me improve as a student overall.
