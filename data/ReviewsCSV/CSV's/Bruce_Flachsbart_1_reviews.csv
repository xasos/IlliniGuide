Mandatory,good,average,average,0,26242816,0,,good,4,ME270,"Weekly homework, Biweekly labs, and semester long project with three presentations makes this class quite a handful for only 3 credit hours given. Bruce is a relatively nice guy. His class is very unorganized and the exams had multiple spelling errors on them, which made the 50min tests a nightmare to finish on time.

Doesn't want to clarify vagueness and blames students for lack of understanding. Every aspect of the course fails to teach, so you have to teach yourself, not that you'll be rewarded for doing so.
