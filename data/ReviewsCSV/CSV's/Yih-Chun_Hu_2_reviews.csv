N/A,good,average,good,0,20212081,0,,good,5,ECE190,I personally liked having Hu as my ECE190 professor. It is true that he doesn't seem to care much about his students. He skipped the first day of lecture and randomly went to Singapore without announcement and made the other professor cover his sections for a couple weeks. But he targets the savvy students so you'll learn a lot if you are above avg,05/06/2012,2,2.0,,4,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I am doing well in the class, but its because I'm skipping his lectures and attending LeMay's lectures.
