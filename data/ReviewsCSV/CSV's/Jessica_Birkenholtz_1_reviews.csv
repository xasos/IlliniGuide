Mandatory,good,good,good,0,26479839,0,,good,4,CWL350,"Prof. Birkenholtz is a very engaging, enthusiastic professor. If you are interesting in Hinduism, definitely take a class with her. But don't take her 350 class unless you have a ton of time to read - we read an avg of  60pgs/class. She is super understanding if you need any extensions or are having trouble with the class. Be sure to communicate!!",05/05/2016,5,5.0,,4,N/A,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Pretty small class, so expect to participate. LOADS of reading. 2 midterm and 1 final. Bi-weekly response papers to readings (750-1000 words) which count for a significant portion of the grade. Also weekly reading quizzes. Mandatory attendance!",05/01/2016,4,4.0,,4,N/A,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
Mandatory,average,good,average,2,25797565,1,,average,2,RLST286,This Introduction to Hinduism class seemed far from an introductory course. She expected us to all have a pretty solid foundation of knowledge in the religion. Many of the students in my class did have a solid foundation and she seemed to enjoy them more. Would not take again. Hard A and tests incredibly lengthy and detailed. GL,12/22/2015,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,person,people

Do not depend on the lectures and TA sections. Weekly quizzes, and they are not the easiest. Tests are difficult, long, and require a lot of analysis; no practice exams. On a scale of 1-10, the amount of effort you have to put in for an A is 8.",12/19/2015,4,4.0,,3,Low,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person
