The material gets a little dry sometimes, but she does a  good job explaining everything. The tests are based on the power points (posted online). If you go to class, do well on the (open book) reading quizzes, and put in a little effort, you'll get an A. ",12/08/2014,2,2.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
N/A,average,average,average,2,22571698,0,,average,3,ANTHRO101,One of the worst classes I've ever taken.  Always dreaded going to lecture and half the time she just showed films instead of actually lecturing-lazy.  Tests were based on lecture PowerPoints and films.  Easy 10 point weekly online reading quizzes also that can boost your grade.  So overall an easy BUT boring class and not a great professor,12/16/2013,2,2.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
