N/A,good,poor,good,0,21249585,0,,good,5,PHYS211,"He gets props because the lower level physics curriculum at u of I is about as good as it gets from a learning perspective. I.e. a few professors' research was based exclusively on how students learn best and making their class better (see smartphysics). I believe Jose himself didn't work on that, however his doctorate is in physics education. All in all he's no walter lewin, the man is simply your average very good physics professor. Can't really go wrong with him.",01/12/2013,1,1.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I didn't think he went into material that would be helpful on the quizzes or tests as much as he could have, so this class involved a lot of learning on your own.",12/19/2012,4,4.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
