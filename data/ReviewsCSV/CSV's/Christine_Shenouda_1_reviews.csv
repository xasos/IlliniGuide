She ignores questions from students, the tests are way more difficult than they need to be, and she literally told us ""don't think about the questions too much, just be stereotypical."" She's teaching us gender stereotypes that are outdated/not applicable anymore and only teaches us stereotypical issues, not how to solve them.",02/25/2016,3,3.0,,2,Meh,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Tests were much harder than they should have been, but she does curve them quite fairly.. TA's graded papers very harshly (but that of course depends on your TA). The class content itself was very interesting, it was just taught quite dryly.",12/23/2015,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
