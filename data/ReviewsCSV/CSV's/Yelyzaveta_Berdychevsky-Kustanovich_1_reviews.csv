Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,23177776,0,,poor,1,RST370,The worst class I have taken in 3 years while at U of I.  Each class there is a quiz or a group exercise which she grades very tough and the only grades in the class except for a cumulative final.  She is very poor at explaining simple concepts and I would rather watch paint dry than try and listen to one of her lectures. Do not take this.,05/06/2014,5,5.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,3,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,B,,people,people
