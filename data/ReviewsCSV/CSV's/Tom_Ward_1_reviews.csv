N/A,good,poor,good,0,19876043,0,,good,4,MUS100,"Dr. Ward was not the best lecturer...monotone, uhmms,etc. BUT I've never met a person more in love with his subject nor one more knowledgable in their chosen profession. He expects students to be present (in mind and body), to know the listening sections, and able write proficiently, succinctly and accurately.  On top of that I hear he is a great racquetball player and well rounded person in most subjects.  He's so cute too! and his mustache and hair look so debonair!",03/03/2012,1,1.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I once counted 168 &quot;um's&quot; in the first 30 minutes of lecture. His exam questions are on the most obscure facts. Forget trying to learn the timeline of history - You purely need to memorize names to pass",12/13/2007,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He's obviously a brilliant man, but he should NOT be in front of a class, nor should he be designing a curriculum for undergrads. He's completely monotone - so you have NO idea what's important, tangents are a'plenty, & tests are so ridiculous that TA's have to curve on the sly",10/27/2007,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

 Ignoring the fact that &quot;F major&quot; wouldn't be defined for another 200 years. And that is just the beginning of the insight Wardy brings to the lectern. In addition he shows up late and holds us late and his tests only have the most irrelevant info from the book.",03/27/2006,4,4.0,,1,It's my life,1,1.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
