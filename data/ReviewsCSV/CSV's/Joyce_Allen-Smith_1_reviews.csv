Do not regret taking the class though, the information learned is amazing, I just wish she was easier on the tests. Bring pencils, the tests are ridiculously long, and all essays.",03/14/2013,5,5.0,,3,Low,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,21164738,0,,average,3,ACE454,Normal level readings BUT as previous post. Brutal grader!!! Answers for the tests arey never enough...she always find a way not to get you a full credit. Extremely hard grader. Only take it if you will be there 100% of time & do 100% of readings/homework and participate (she grades it harshly)...Not much else...,12/25/2012,5,5.0,,2,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,good,average,0,21014640,0,,good,5,ACE454,Moderate class and great Professor! Lot's of reading but it's a 400-level after all. Test are in between easy and moderate if you ACTUALLY read the assigned readings & go to class.
