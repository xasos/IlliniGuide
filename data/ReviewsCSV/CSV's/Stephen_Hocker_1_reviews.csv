Mandatory,average,average,average,1,22471969,0,,poor,3,MACS331,"RUN FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. Worst class I have ever taken on this campus. He is always late, unorganized, forgetful and can never give a clear answer for anything. Never replies to any emails, doesn't go by the syllabus, and never returns assignments. Lectures are rambles and topics are uninteresting. Don't take this professor for ANYTHING.",12/08/2013,2,2.0,,1,Really into it,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,person

Kind of of rambles a lot during lecture. Don't look to learn a whole lot from this class but it is an easy gen ed.,03/08/2012,1,1.0,,4,Low,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

His lectures were ramblings, he never returned any of our work or graded any of it, and he didn't assign our final project until a week before the final. My classmates and I were frustrated with his lack of organization and the fact that he was always late to class. I would not recommend this professor.",11/20/2011,2,2.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
