The first third of the class was about things I'd already learned..if I hadn't already known the information, I would have been entirely lost, much like I was the rest of the semester. He has a very thick accent and makes everything harder than it should be. You need an excellent TA in this class.",03/01/2009,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He teaches complex topics extremely fast and faces the chalkboard the whole time so you cant see what he's writing or understand what he's saying.
