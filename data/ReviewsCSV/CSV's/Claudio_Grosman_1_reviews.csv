Enjoyable class overall, and Prof Grosman's accent isn't too difficult to understand.",10/12/2015,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

There is very little information to know, and you'll be tested on concepts rather than little bits of information hidden in slides. You don't HAVE to attend lecture, but it helps because he will emphasize the most important points. Exams are not tricky.",10/14/2011,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Incredibly articulate and is never just spouting bio jargon. Tests you mostly on concepts rather than random factoids like other MCB courses.",11/04/2008,4,4.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,12316678,0,,good,5,MCB401,"Obviously this is an MCB advanced credit which automatically makes it rather dry and boring, but he's really clear (in spite of a slight accent), the exams are only over lectures-no book, and only 3 exams total.  The exams are over general ideas so you don't have to cram all the details like in other MCBs.  A low to medium-difficulty MCB class.  :)",10/25/2006,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
