Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,22313905,0,,good,5,AFRO174,She is a very cool professor. Her class is not hard at all. She made the class interesting...I enjoyed it. I also find it funny that someone said that it is hard to have a debate with her because students in the class conduct debates and she addresses both sides equally in my opinion.,11/14/2013,1,1.0,,4,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A+,,people,people

The chances of having an intellectual debate with this woman are slim to none and she makes copious amounts of claims that aren't backed by data. Her class is truly a disgrace to higher education.",08/09/2013,2,2.0,,2,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
