He was funny and the biggest issue people had with him was that he'd get numbers wrong on the board, but the most important thing was that he was still able to teach us concepts, etc. Also, cheat sheets really important for tests and work hard on the hw to learn the material.",06/08/2014,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A-,,people,people

Everything on the test comes from the lecture notes and pretty straight forward. He may have an accent, but it's not that hard to understand when he gives lecture once you get used to it.

Everyone is always saying how impossible it is to finish the exams- that's not true at all. Just know the material and then it's a breeze. Although, it is important to know when he says &quot;SPASTIC&quot;, it means specific. That took me weeks.",04/16/2009,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,average,average,average,0,15377482,0,,average,3,CHBE221,I got a B in this class. He has foreign accent but understandable.  His lecture is not mandatory but gives out lecture notes in class which isnt on the web.  But everything in the lecture notes are completely from the textbook. So I really didnt attend his class because I learned more from the textbook.  There are no quizzes but homeworks are hard.,01/15/2009,3,3.0,,2,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

You don't really need to go to class, just get your notes from a friend. Exams are more challenging than past exams. Some people complain about not being able to understand him,but he's not horrible.
