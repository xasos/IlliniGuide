Classes are essentially discussion-based or prep for events at the museum. Also, Anne is extremely funny. It's a very fun class. Take it before you're a senior!!! so you can keep volunteering!",05/08/2013,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Anne is really cool and has a ton of art museum experience, but she also trusts students to stay involved and get the job done (You get to plan and lead events and tours for the Krannert Art Museum). Grading is very fair too.",08/31/2010,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
