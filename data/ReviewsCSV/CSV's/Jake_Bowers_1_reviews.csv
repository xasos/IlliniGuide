N/A,good,average,good,0,24291870,0,,good,4,PS230,"Professor Bowers is incredibly helpful. The work itself is difficult and you have to come to class, but if you do that you're pretty much guaranteed a good grade. I never did the outside reading but participated and still got A+. Don't be afraid to ask for help, especially on the final project. He just wants to see that you're trying to learn.",01/15/2015,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,21917320,0,,good,4,PS300,Prof Bowers is a really nice guy and sort of facilitates class discussion rather than lecture which is cool. Reading the books was only a jumping off point for discussions that became really interesting. Not the greatest class for shy people. Grade is based off participation and two papers based off your own ideas.Recommend for scifi/polisci lovers,06/23/2013,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,20182861,0,,good,5,PS300,Future Politics. Jake Bowers is the sweetest professor. He runs his class so that you'll get out what you put in. Be prepared to participate in class discussions. He values opinions and independent ideas. HIGHLY recommended for mature students who will do the work and not slack off. The work load isn't that bad.
