She has snuck around the system and locked the grades at U of I before displaying it on the course website so that nobody can complain! I though chemistry couldn't get any more ridiculous, but these two classes prove that she is the worst out of all my chem teachers!

There seemed to be no communication between her and her TAs for 233, and reports took forever to be returned. 232 was not too hard, 233 was easy overall, but the final was increadibly hard and didn't test us on what we learned, but on how many picky details we were able to memorize.",05/23/2006,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Most labs took 2-4 weeks to get back . Didn't want to return pre-labs before post-lab was due. Took off up to 10pts on 30-35 pt labs for not doing things that weren't on the &quot;to-do&quot; list.
