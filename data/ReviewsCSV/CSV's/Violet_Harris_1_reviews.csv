Very knowledgeable and obviously respected in her field, but not engaging and definitely not encouraging.

A very strict woman with the attitude of her class is the most important of all others.

Yes, she has an opinion and isn't afraid to let you know what it is.  I may be nuts, but I *want* professors to challenge my ideas and my thinking.

She could be a bit tough to work with at times, but she had so much knowledge to offer and really opened my mind to a lot of new ideas!

She makes you feel stupid when you answer questions.  The midterm was ridiculous and we were given 1 and a half days to complete what ended up to be an 8pg single-spaced paper.
