N/A,good,poor,good,0,24922206,0,,good,5,461,I was very surprised by the instructor's British accent & credentials. He definitely knows his stuff as he was an investment banker at Morgan Stanley prior to the financial crisis of 2007-08. He knows that mostly older students take the class so he does everything he can to make sure that they earn As. Great class. Great teacher. Highly recommend. ,05/31/2015,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
