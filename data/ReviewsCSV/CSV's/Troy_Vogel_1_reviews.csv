CHBE 431 is poorly paced causing some learning to be wasted and multiple assignments to be due at the same time (unnecessarily).

Luckily the professor is often very clear on what he expects and is always willing to help after or outside of class. Class is not mandatory and notes are online, but contain gaps that are filled in only in class. Professor is big on class interaction, which helps learning significantly.",08/24/2013,5,5.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A-,,people,people
