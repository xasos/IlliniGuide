N/A,average,average,average,0,13623530,0,,average,2,ARCH351,Overall a good professor. The material is pretty easy. The most annoying thing about this class is that you can't understand what hes saying unless you pay close attention.  He is foreign so he speaks with a soft accent. The guy knows his material esp. since he studied at MIT.  Gives extra credit the class is easy the final was tough.,11/08/2007,2,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
