She picked a variety of good literature as well.  She grades fairly and actually gives you good comments where she feels necessary.  The course expectations are also pretty easy.",07/18/2009,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The class is a solid gateway class for English majors and, if you don't get an A, it's probably because you missed class a lot.",08/08/2008,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Seems to like the students who like her and laugh with her -- discussion seems centered around what she considers to be the right answers.

N/A,good,average,good,0,14562743,0,,good,5,ENGL200,"Very energetic personality. Really cares and admires students for who they are. For her, classroom camaraderie was just as important as the material itself. Quizzes are a pain and unnecessary (what am I, in 5th grade&#63;), but essays are fair and well written. Always available for help, even it if it has nothing to do with the material. Good character",06/06/2008,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

We take a few terms and grammar quizzes, but the rest of the time, we sit around in class and talk.  If you pay attention in class, tests and assignments aren't hard.
