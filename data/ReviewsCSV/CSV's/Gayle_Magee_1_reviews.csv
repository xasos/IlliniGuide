Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,24837176,1,online,poor,1,MUS130,Be careful when you choose to take this class because the quizzes are not relevant to anything the class website provided. They provide you a long video for every quiz and there are only one question in the quiz about what was mentioned in the video. The textbook is also useless. You could not find anything relevant to the quiz question. ,05/15/2015,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,person,people
