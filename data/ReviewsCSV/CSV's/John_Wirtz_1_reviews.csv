N/A,poor,good,poor,0,24783191,0,,poor,1,ADV310,Wirtz is one of the most paranoid professors I have ever come across. He will call out students during class for taking pictures of the slides and gets smart when students ask him to slow down. His cynical and condescending attitude is really off putting. How he has ever had any job involving interactions with other humans is beyond me.  ,05/09/2015,5,5.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Asks stupid questions on exams like what did wirtz say about... Random participation 8 times throughout the semester, doesn't post notes online, lots of work in the last 3 weeks of class.

All of the information on the tests is covered in lecture (important stuff highlighted). He has so much knowledge to offer if you can get past him being a little preachy. I am certain that I've benefited from taking this class because of the content, and the rest is fine if you try.",11/19/2014,3,3.0,,3,Low,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Tests are WAY too specific, asks a, b, c, a and b, a b c and d. Most BS professor I've ever had in all of professorship. Doesn't matter how prepared you are, it matters how much he likes your particular class.",05/14/2014,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
