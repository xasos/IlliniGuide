N/A,good,average,good,0,24950783,0,,good,5,SOCW199,"Trent is great! He's helpful and willing to work with students. Go to class, go to class, go to class. There aren't many tests given. There is extra credit. Make sure you participate in class and do your assignments. Put effort into the class and you should do well. Would definitely take this class again and recommend to others!
