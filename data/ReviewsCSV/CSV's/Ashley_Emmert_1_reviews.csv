She's rude in class, doesn't bother to clarify questions, assigns a RIDICULOUS amount of work for a supposedly ""easy"" gened, and grades with insanely high expectations.

The assignment expectations are completely unclear and the class material is absolutely inaccurate. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER!

She is very unclear about what she wants and penalizes you for her lack of clarity.  On the flip side, she does allow you to redo old assignments for a better grade.  DO THIS!
