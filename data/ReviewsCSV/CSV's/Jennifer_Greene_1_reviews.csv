Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,25264654,0,,good,5,EPSY575,"She is a very resourceful professor. She is also helpful. The class is very much focused on theory, which is the way I like it. The final project is practical. She encourages critical thinking. I loved it! A lot of reading, not so many assignments but a huge final project.",10/18/2015,4,4.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,good,0,19777379,0,,good,3,EPSY470,"I've taken both her evaluation methods class and her evaluation theory class. The methods class, in particular, was well done. We conducted a real evaluation, culminating in a presentation to the client. Invaluable experience for those interested in evaluation research. The theory class was also interesting although some of it went over my head :)",01/27/2012,4,4.0,,5,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Honestly, I was quite disappointed. Her class was so abstract and theory-driven which lacked practicality. Also she seemed a bit disrespectful towards international students.",02/20/2010,3,3.0,,1,It's my life,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
