Mandatory,poor,good,average,1,26312843,0,,average,1,BADM310,"This class is miserable. Both her and her colleague just read the slides word for word off of the powerpoint and never once brought their expertise to the classroom. This class could have been so much better had she actually talked about her experiences in the work place. Unfortunately, attendance is mandatory for extra credit",04/17/2016,4,4.0,,4,N/A,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,people,person
