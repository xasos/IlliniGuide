Honestly, I cannot see why anyone would do badly in his GEOG 106 course ... his exams and research papers are SO EASY that you only need to read the key terms in the book.

Tests are hard, require knowledge of specific details of the material. Lectures are important, sometimes attendance is counted towards the grade. I hated this class. You need to work really hard (take notes, do readings , attend all lectures) to pass. Regret",01/06/2015,4,4.0,,3,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,C,,people,people

Though gives you study guides for the tests, he tests you small facts from the textbook and makes the tests feel like you'd better memorize a majority of the textbook just to get good grades.  The tests doesn't match very well with what you've learned in class. ",12/24/2014,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,person,people

The problem with the class was not that the material was hard but his tests did not match what you learned.  3 tests in class and 1 long paper.  Gives study guides to some tests not all and questions test small facts from the book.
