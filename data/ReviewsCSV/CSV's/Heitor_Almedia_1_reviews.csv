His lectures are to the point without fluff and extraneous words. He is very clear as to what is expected of you. He is very fair in how he grades. Projects are graded lightening fast. He was always available to help. He truly wanted us to learn the material. Great guy!,10/22/2015,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

Is straight-forward about what he wants on assignments with right answers, and rather liberal on questions with open answers. His class also teaches you a lot of material, especially if you're new to finance.  Real-world examples also help you learn too.",05/28/2015,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
