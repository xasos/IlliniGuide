Dr. K. does tend to get a bad rap, but he's a wealth of knowledge & a very nice guy. You have to put in some effort on your own (or during lab) to commit things to memory. Otherwise, it's nearly impossible to visualize physiological concepts during lectures & exams.",03/03/2009,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Attending classes and reading the material are important as the tests are quite difficult. He's a nice guy, but he does get a bad wrap.
