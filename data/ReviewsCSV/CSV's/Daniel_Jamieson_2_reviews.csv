N/A,poor,good,poor,0,20940481,0,,poor,1,CHEM102,He is really the worst teacher I've ever had. We got really far behind the scheduled materials but still gonna be tested on them. You won't learn anything new from this class if you have him as your prof. Even he himself get the concepts wrong sometimes. Avoid at all cost. I learned half of the materials and still is getting only B's.,12/03/2012,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
