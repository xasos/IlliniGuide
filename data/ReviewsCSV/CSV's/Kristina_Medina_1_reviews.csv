N/A,average,average,average,0,15405998,0,,average,3,LAST170,She is a foreign language TA that was teaching Latin American Studies. Although she tries to be helpful and means well she really isn't helpful. She learns the material with you and does not clarify and often is flat out wrong.  She does grade easy though. However going to the other TAs classes a few times revealed that the other TAs are way better,01/22/2009,2,2.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
