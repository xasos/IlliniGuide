The TAs are condescending, grade with a bias, don't answer emails, and everything is about how evil white people are.

Directions on writing assignments were very vague, and not made clear until after the due date. The TAs basically were the teachers, and very unfair in their grading. I feel the same way about the class as the comment before mine. Biased grading. Left class upset many times.",04/14/2011,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,person

REAL diverse. Halfway through the semester, it has gotten REALLY old.
