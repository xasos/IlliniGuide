During my studio with her, She probably came and checked in on my sections' work 3 times in the whole half of a semester. She never remembered any of our names. She just shows no interest in teaching. Her lectures were boreing, and she didn't keep me interested in the course at all.",12/16/2011,3,3.0,,1,It's my life,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Little room for creativity, at least in 271; just do well what is asked for. Be the photocopier. Most importantly, listen to your TA.

Projects had little to nothing to do with architecture, and lectures were nothing but slideshows of weird avant-garde artwork. Very poor speaker-every other word is &quot;um.&quot; Devoid of any emotion and extremely spacey-despite me specifically talking to her many times, she never remembered who I was.",04/14/2008,2,2.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She would set up a still life and leave or just stand and stare at the wall as we were drawing- she wouldn't walk around to give criticism, help, etc. from her on your drawing unless you approached her for it.
