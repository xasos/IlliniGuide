N/A,average,poor,average,1,23606511,2,,poor,2,MATH416,"Math416 is supposed to be a proof based class while he made it more like Math415 which only has some short easy proof. He gives extra credits if you present reviews questions on the blackboard and all exams will be based on the review problems he gives us. So if you want to get easy A then go for him, if you want learn strong proofs then avoid him.",09/22/2014,1,1.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person

The homework was fair and the tests were easy.  Before each test, he would give out ~25 problems and guarantee that the test would be made out of 6 of those only changed slightly. Overall, I learned a lot.  Review sessions are useless though",05/12/2011,2,2.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
