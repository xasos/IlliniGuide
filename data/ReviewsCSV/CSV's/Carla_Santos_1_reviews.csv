Not Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,24902656,0,,good,5,RST330,Professor Santos is great at what she does. Certainly would recommend this class to anyone looking to for-fill their Social and Behavioral Sciences requirement. Lectures and assignments are very clearly described in the syllabus and fairly graded. Would definitely take this professor again!,05/26/2015,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
