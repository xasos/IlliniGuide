N/A,average,good,average,0,18618633,0,,poor,3,ACCY304,She is clearly the worst teacher I have ever had. First you have to suck up. Her overemphasis on participation leads to a horse race where kids try to maximize quantity of handraising. Grading is subjective and nonsense.

Bol is a good teacher, however like everyone stated her grading doesn't make any sense. The midterm average was a 57%.
