You don't learn too terribly much, tests are easy (if you study what you've been taught...which I did not :x), and he's very easy to talk to.  I recommend Prof. Rushing to everyone! You get 3 grades in the sememster.  PS..read directions",11/20/2008,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

There's also a project which he'll help you with so it's no prob.  It's only a one credit class, but you can learn alot from this guy although sometimes a bit unclear. He's always willing to help clear up any discrepancies though!",07/27/2006,1,1.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
