N/A,average,good,average,0,14886385,0,,average,2,ECE598,This class is really hard. She first assumed that everyone knows the background but she was better later. I dropped the class because i couldnt follow but she tries quite hard. She &quot;wondered&quot; why more people sit in the class than are registered...given that there are no young female faculty in CS- duh!,10/21/2008,5,5.0,,3,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,14816858,0,,good,3,ECE462,"She is quite disorganized with the lectures and puts a lot of presure on the students to learn on their own. She assumes everyone is a genius and/or are really exposed to the keywords. She is quite enthusiastic about the subject though, which is a plus. I wish she'd pay less attention to her appearance and more to organizing her course.",09/15/2008,4,4.0,,4,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,14554530,0,,good,4,ECE462,"She covered topics that were practical and relevant. She has tons of enthusiasm and is a great communicator. The homeworks and midterms became much better after she assessed the level of the class. I got an internship in NVIDIA because of the stuff i learnt in her class. Altogether, good stuff!

Makes tons of errors during class (I don't think she knows the material), homeworks take too long are are often unclear/wrong, and the midterm had nothing to do with what we covered prior to it.
