He is not at all that specific when he speaks about his material but he asks some of THE most specific questions on his exams. Basically, his exams are not really like what he expects us to know. Supposed to be easier than 250, but his lack of clarity makes it slightly more difficult. Would not take him again.",04/27/2016,3,3.0,,4,N/A,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

I do not feel that his exams reflected what he wanted us to learn. Half of the exams are easy and straightforward, while the other half full of very long questions with several possible answers.

His tests are really straight forward and fair so you can't really get upset at him for writing the questions.

The history of genetics - how we discovered what we know about it - is not an easy thing to explain, yet he did it well, straight to the point and covered the big picture. I like how he gave us the big picture look at it all, and left us with a good understanding of most the techniques used in genetics.",05/15/2014,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,person

He droned on about topics you learn in high school and then gave tests that tested how well you memorized his slides. Although his questions were extremely easy, especially compared to Bellini or 250, they were poorly worded.",05/02/2012,2,2.0,,2,Low,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
