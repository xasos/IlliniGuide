She's very intelligent, a little bipolar, and kind of rough grader on essays (only 2 though - bad if you bomb one which is easy to do -- have to write what *she* wants). Pop quizzes.  Expects a lot. Speaks in semicolons, which can make her difficult to follow. Probably great for higher level classes, though.",11/01/2006,4,4.0,,3,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
