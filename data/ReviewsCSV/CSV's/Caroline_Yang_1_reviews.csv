N/A,good,poor,good,0,22380452,0,,good,4,AAS100,Easy A general course. No homework or long exams. Homework are mostly done in class with film watching.

N/A,good,average,average,0,20173491,0,,good,4,AAS100,Her lectures are usually pretty boring but half the time you just watch a documentary/movie/clip about Asian Americans and answer some questions about it (those are the lecture quizzes). The class is easy. Just 2 two-page essays and 2 exams. The exams are easy if you go over the lecture slides and study guides. Don't do the readings!

N/A,average,good,poor,0,17754291,0,,poor,2,AAS199,I really did not like Caroline Yang. She is very hard to have a discussion with. She simply nods over and over again and doesn't help you along the way at all. So you end up talking and talking not knowing if you're even in the ballpark or not. Horrible tests. Horrible final.

N/A,poor,good,poor,0,17554692,1,,poor,1,AAS120,"This is one of the worst teachers I have ever had. She uses too many words to describe simple concepts, is repetitive, boring, and tests are exceedingly difficult and unrelated to material, to say the least. I only got an A- in the class because the curve on the midterm and final were so ridiculous. Do NOT take a course with Caroline Yang.",08/27/2010,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
