N/A,good,good,good,0,14692780,0,,good,5,JOUR415,"Very difficult class with a lot of work, but Prof. Dash will take you to the next level. He seems uptight and set in his ways, but his strict mannerisms foster an environment where students who like being challenged excel. I took this class for his strictness, never have I learned so much. Would suggest for anyone not afraid to be challenged!",07/28/2008,5,5.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,poor,0,13951744,0,,poor,2,JOUR415,"Dash is a HORRIBLE professor. Don't expect any help with your writing, any comments on any stories, or any compassion towards students in general. He asks his students to do an insane amount of work and gives  nothing in return. On top of that, he is rude, arrogant, and seems to enjoy embarrassing his students. Get another lab teacher if you can.",01/06/2008,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He even called his colleague, our professor by the wrong name numerous times even after being corrected. Seems like he was pretty set in his ways, but he's won a lot of awards and has very interesting stories to share.",05/25/2005,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
