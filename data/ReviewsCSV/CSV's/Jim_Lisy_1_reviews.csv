N/A,average,average,average,0,17195923,0,,average,3,CHEM204,"Very competent professor, and very doable class. However, to be honest, his teaching could be better. Overall though, in terms of difficulty, it wasn't that bad, and from what I've heard, compared to previous 202/204 classes, this one is much easier. Doable, but could be better",05/13/2010,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,average,0,16961610,0,,average,3,CHEM204,he makes chem so much harder than it needs to be. I can see why hes good for higher level classes but not for intro classes. He blatantly refuses to alter his teaching methods to suit the needs and requests of the class. his tests are impossible. and he is very pompous. my opinion of him started high but got worse as the semester went on.,04/07/2010,5,5.0,,2,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He is very helpful if you ask him a question, and takes the extra time to explain WHY a theory works.  He never presents a concept without ample theoretical or mathmatical evidence.  However, he does come off as pompous in lecture.",04/02/2010,5,5.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,16934895,0,,poor,1,CHEM204,"Lisy is one of the most pompous professors that I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with, he over complicates things, he laughs at his students questions, lectures consist of him reading straight off of the power point, and he blatantly refuses to write on the board even after we requested it several times.  And his tests suck.",03/31/2010,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

No matter what your grade in the class, you're going to come out knowing soooo much material so well it's going to shock you.  I'd take any class from him in a heartbeat.",05/07/2008,5,5.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
