He curves the grades generously and if you deserve to pass, you will, even though the content is pretty tough. He can come down pretty harsh on people he thinks don't deserve to be in the major, which can be a weird discussion, but overall he's fine.",12/17/2015,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B-,,people,people
