One of many wonderful things about Larry's classes is that he provides you with all the relevant course materials and let you choose your own focus of application.

N/A,good,good,good,0,12013209,0,,good,5,PSYCH594,"Explains stats concepts very well, but the course is still fairly theoretical. Little practical on interpretation of results, a whirlwind tour of a dozen multivariate techniques in one semester. Some find the theoretical stuff too heavy, but he explains well, and all the math has a point, unlike other stats profs. And he is very funny.",06/17/2006,4,4.0,,4,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
