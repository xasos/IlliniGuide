Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,26060263,0,,poor,1,MACS101,WORST Professor I have ever had and I mean WORST. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. She is extremely rude and also makes everything about race. She doesn't attempt to help any students unless they are a student of color. She grades the weekly essays incredibly hard and gives horrible feedback at the same time. Her prompts make no sense whatsoever.,02/16/2016,4,4.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,WD,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,3,24695413,0,,poor,1,MACS101,"Avoid her at all costs. It's an intro class and advanced comp class, but it's impossible to meet her expectations. Her feedback is pointless and wrong half the time. Then, in re-writes based off her comments, she'll give the same score or lower while pointing out other things she didn't point out originally. She is the worst TA you could ever.",04/29/2015,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
Mandatory,poor,good,poor,3,24691804,0,,poor,1,MACS101,"I've never felt such strong dislike for a professor. For a 101 it was significantly more difficult that was necessary. Although a bit more work should be expected from an advanced comp class, the writing that Kerry seems to want is unattainable. She grades unnecessarily harsh and offers NO positive or clear feedback. Be prepared to be upset weekly.",04/28/2015,4,4.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,average,3,23833134,0,,poor,1,MACS101,"If you have to take this class, definitely find a different T.A. This class was much harder than it needed to be due to the lack of clarity from Wilson on almost every assignment. She grades the weekly assignments very harshly and offers a lot of criticism but no positivefeedback. Be prepared to teach yourself a lot of the material for this class.
