N/A,poor,average,poor,0,11801587,0,,poor,1,ACCY202,"Finnegan as a professor is pretty useless.  He plays a lot of videos during the Tax portion, and he makes habit of listening to the 1% of the class that claim it's too easy, so he makes the exams and quizzes more difficult.  He's a nice guy, and wants people to do well, but studying outside of class is absolutely necessary.",05/02/2006,3,3.0,,1,It's my life,1,1.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
