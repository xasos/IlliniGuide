N/A,average,good,poor,0,23521565,0,,poor,2,ACCY301,"All around awful. Do not take his summer Accy 301 class. He is terrible at communicating what needs to be done, he's never around to help, and it didn't seem like he cared about the students at all. He knows his stuff so his lectures are in depth and interesting but if you are looking for a good grade in 301 in a summer section this isn't the guy",08/12/2014,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I really recommend his class for every student. He is so funny too and create jokes in class. But you always have to be on top of the readings and be prepared to be called upon to answer questions in class!!",01/29/2014,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Bright is hilarious, but his explanations are confusing and discussions move slowly because no one reads the 50-60 page chapters. Know the journal entries for all types of problems for the exams.",01/09/2014,2,2.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
