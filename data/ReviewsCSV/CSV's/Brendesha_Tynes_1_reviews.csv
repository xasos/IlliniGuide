N/A,poor,average,poor,0,20711338,0,,poor,1,EDUC506,This professor is terrible! She doesn't have a clue as to how to teach a class. Her classes are boring with no structure and all she does it talk about what she studied and researched in her studies. The class is just all over the place with absolutely no organization. DON'T TAKE HER! It will drive you insane!,10/17/2012,3,3.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Ideas   with which she did not agree were not tolerated or even presented.  Even the required textbook for the class was written and edited by her.  If a white professor taught black stereotypes the way she teaches based on white stereotypes, he or she would be fired",05/21/2009,2,2.0,,2,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,15389405,0,,good,4,AFRO398,Professor Tynes clearly cares very much for her students and worked to create a learning environment conducive to the somewhat tough subjects discussed. She really earned our respect for how hard she worked and cared for us.  The class content (Psychology of the African American Child) was information that I think all people need to learn about.,01/19/2009,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,15183693,0,,good,4,EPSY430,Dr. Tynes teaches this course on early adolescent development with themes centering on education and psychology. You'll also examine how external factors like sex/gender/race/socioeconomic status impact psychological development. This course raises important issues. Tynes is open to student feedback and teaches with enthusiasm. You'll learn a lot.,12/13/2008,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Future teachers generally don't want to hurt their students or believe that students are incapable because of their gender, race, or economic status, but Professor Tynes had no faith in our abilities and genuine interests in improving lives of all of our students.",11/17/2006,4,4.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
