N/A,good,poor,good,0,23891301,0,,good,4,CEE460,"This professor is very patient and friendly. His lecture is very focused on concepts and behavior rather than just solve problems. Also, it's one of the rare ""do your job and you'll get an A"" course! The only down side I can say about him is his lecture notes are not very detailed, but that is not a problem if you write down what he says.

Not Mandatory,poor,average,poor,1,22762431,0,,poor,1,CEE460,"Grading was very lax, but the course could have been run much, much better. He was often late to lecture and it seemed like he didn't have a lesson plan and was just winging it. Spent little time discussing homework, the project, exam prep, etc, in lecture and instead made you go to office hours to talk about it which wasn't always convenient.",01/16/2014,2,2.0,,2,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,person
