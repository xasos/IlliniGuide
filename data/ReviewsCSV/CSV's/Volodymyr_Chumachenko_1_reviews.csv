N/A,good,poor,good,0,21592148,0,,good,5,UKR113,This class has been one of my best classes at UIUC. I took this class because I needed it for my gen ed and I really started looking forward to attend this class. The professor is very informative and very entertaining. There are 2 really easy assignments and a final. You must go to class because he knows if you don't. I highly recommend it!,04/24/2013,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The textbook readings did not line up with what we learned in class and were not tested, so buying the textbook is not necessary.",06/09/2011,1,1.0,,3,Low,3,3.0,3,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,18684193,0,,good,5,UKR113,"A very strangely funny professor. This course doesn't really require a lot of work to pull of an A, but I actually learned a lot about Ukraine. He is very blunt and honest about his opinions (i.e. how he dislikes Soviet Union/the poor technology advancement at UIUC lol). Take this class so you can relax, learn about another culture, and get an A!",05/31/2011,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Overall his class was simple and easy as long as you come and sign the attendance sheet most days.  There is only attendance, a few (2-3) short papers and a final exam that go into grades, and he is not a tough grader.",04/16/2010,1,1.0,,5,Meh,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
