Mandatory,average,good,poor,1,25245157,0,,poor,2,CEE380,"This guy is horrible.  The curriculum is not hard but this guy will fight you every step of the way when you are trying to learn.  I.E. you cannot print out practice tests, powerpoints are both locked and missing slides and information, and lecture is of course next to no help.
