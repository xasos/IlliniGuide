N/A,good,average,good,0,20758313,0,,good,4,LING410,Fantastic instructor. Always excited to be teaching and spreads that excitement. Will go out of his way to help his students. It's important to go to class because only outlines of course material are made available. Read the articles he assigns. The textbooks are useful but less important if you go to class. Exams are not difficult if you keep up.,10/31/2012,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
