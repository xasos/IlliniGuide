He also allows all of the papers to be written in groups, so try to make a buddy or two.

He may be interesting to listen to in other classes but not in intro to American literature. He is also so slow at grading. He is uncomfortable to talk to one on one.

However, he did take a long time to grade papers and tests, we ended up skipping some papers because he was so backed up. He encourages you to think for yourself and make the most of your education.

You'll spend the entire semesters on memos and letters. Definitely go to his office hours and have him look over your drafts. He will let you know what to fix. He is quite helpful.
