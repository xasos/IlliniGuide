Mandatory,good,average,good,1,22919072,0,,good,4,ECE329,"Pete was the coolest professor I've had yet. Yeah he used the slides a lot, and yeah he got excited and sometimes missed small parts, but he was among the most willing people here at the university level to help me when I had questions. His best quality is that he isn't stuck up like some of the other staff, he's laid back and chill.",03/17/2014,3,3.0,,5,Low,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,B,,people,person

He constantly goes off on tangents, clicks rapidly back and forth between slides, and asks ""does that make sense?"" after everything, which is almost always followed by blank stares from the class.",12/12/2013,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Too many professors get caught up in the math of things, but he really focuses on developing an intuition for the physics of behind all of this. Also he's a really nice guy, very approachable, and has a good sense of humor.",11/21/2013,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
