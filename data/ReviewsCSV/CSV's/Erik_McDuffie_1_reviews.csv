He's the most passionate, clear, and helpful of all the professors I've had throughout my education. The class is a bit of work, but it's worth it because all of the readings are relevant to class and each day of class is full of fascinating stuff.",03/11/2014,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

The Midterm/Final are both group papers/presentations so atleast its not a hard sit down final. You can prepare for it and get an A or B if you try hard! there is alot of reading but i did well and didnt do it all,12/23/2012,4,4.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
