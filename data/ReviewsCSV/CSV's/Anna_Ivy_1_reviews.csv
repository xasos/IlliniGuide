N/A,good,average,good,0,18363647,0,,good,5,ENGL300,"I truly believe the ONLY reason Dr. Ivy is not a tenured professor is because she chose to dedicate herself to her family and teaches for the love of the material and her students. She knows her stuff and she lights up when she talks about it. She was ALWAYS available to help me, even now that I am not longer in her class.",04/06/2011,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She can be a hard grader but is definitely fair and only tries to benefit her students.

She had nothing new and insightful to say. We read great texts, but unfortunately our discussions in class did not do the texts justice.

It's not too hard to get an A in the class if you show up, do a good job on the assignments, and participate once in a while in class.

The tough parts come in writing the essays, because you're expected to be able to come up with something meaningful and original. The first exam is a time-cruncher, while the second isn't as bad.
