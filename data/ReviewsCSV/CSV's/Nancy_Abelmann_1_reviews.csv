N/A,good,good,good,1,13309967,0,,good,4,ANTH230,"Professor Abelmann is by far my favorite professor and the best I've had in all four years. She has so much energy and obviously cares about her students. She really tries to make it interesting even for non-majors in the class. It's not necessarily an easy class but she picks great readings, which made it worthwhile.
