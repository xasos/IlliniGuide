N/A,good,good,good,0,20209395,0,,good,5,FIN300,"Wang is good in the sense that he explains things nicely and he doesn't give out homework but his exams are extremely difficult. They're multiple choice and the wrong answers are answers you could calculate if you screw up one step, so be wary. Overall I'm glad I had him because he's easier but I probably would choose Waspi if I had to retake it.",05/06/2012,5,5.0,,5,Low,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
