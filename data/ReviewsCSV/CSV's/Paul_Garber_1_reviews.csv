Be aware all his courses will be heavy on primate behavior, which is either great, or not, depending on your own interests. I agree that the tests were a bit hard in proportion to the subject matter, and he was sometimes slow &/or repetitive in some lectures. Overall, though, I'd have to recommend him.",10/19/2006,4,4.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

It is not a class on the biology of human behavior as much as it is a class on the biology of ape behavior.  The reason for this is because he teaches slowly and repeats stuff and so runs out of time before he gets to humans.
