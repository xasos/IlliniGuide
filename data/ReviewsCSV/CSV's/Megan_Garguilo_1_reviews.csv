Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,26582133,0,,poor,1,SPAN142,This class sucked. It was extremely disorganized and it was up to you to decipher 30 pages of syllabus in SPANISH to find out what is going on. Ask Megan for help and she will defer you to the syllabus/compass page which is all in Spanish. Defines the whole semester: not sure what to do and a teacher who won't explain.,05/15/2016,5,5.0,,2,N/A,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,C-,,people,people

Mandatory,poor,good,poor,3,26516850,0,,poor,1,SPAN142,The WORST spanish teacher. Extreme stickler on participation points. Pretends to be nice but she is super passive aggressive when you ask for help. Rude and doesnt prepare you at all for the exams. She is almost secretive about helping you on the exams and she is terrible at speaking spanish. Take SPAN142 with ANYONE ELSE and you will do better.,05/09/2016,5,5.0,,1,N/A,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,C-,,people,people
