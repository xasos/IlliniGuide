N/A,poor,poor,average,0,23367741,0,,poor,1,LING400,"Most disorganized class ever. No advance notice on when homework is assigned, and always due the next class. Sometimes it gets graded, sometimes not. Prof usually 5-15min late. Got so far behind in the syllabus, he scheduled extra evening classes where he assigned homework due the next class session! Too bad if you worked... Easy grader though.",06/12/2014,1,1.0,,3,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He is a sweet old man though and his deadlines for homework are incredibly flexible. He forget to take attendance often, but attending each class isn't necessary, nor is doing the readings entirely--he gives an outline for the midterm and final :D",01/08/2009,2,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,13373132,0,,good,4,LING400,Professor Bokamba is the coolest!  He doesn't care too much about homework or test grades as longs as you show that you know what to do in class.  He is very good at getting everyone involved and really helps those who don't understand.  Nicest professor ever!!!,08/01/2007,3,3.0,,5,Low,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
