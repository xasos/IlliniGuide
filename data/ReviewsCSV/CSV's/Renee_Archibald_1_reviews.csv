N/A,average,good,average,0,21967734,0,online,poor,2,DANCE100,Her quizzes are questions based off of obscure one line sentences from large readings. It doesn't matter if you read its all about just searching and finding words manually. Also grades wayyyyy too harshly and instructions are very unclear,07/14/2013,5,5.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

You will learn a whole lot taking this class and it's definitely not a blow off! You'll spend a good chunk of time doing not so easy warm ups, but the class is really fun and engaging. No complaints!",05/29/2012,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

For being a 100 level class, Renee Archibald treats it likes it's a 300 level course.  3 page papers for performance reviews (11 pt font, 1.6 spacing), presentations, and constant busy work.  People in different sections said they love the class, so if you take this class, take it with ANYONE else.",11/02/2011,4,4.0,,1,It's my life,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
