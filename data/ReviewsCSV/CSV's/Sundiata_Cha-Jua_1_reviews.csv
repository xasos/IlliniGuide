Very controversial, far-left political philosophies- gets annoyed when you debate with him.

N/A,poor,poor,average,0,11858796,0,,average,1,AFRO101,Class is a joke. Tests are online (open note). Everybody gets an A. He lets you re-do written assignments. He scares you into thinking the tests are in-class and then changes his mind at the last minute. Pretty disorganized class. You don't need to read and can just look all the terms up online.  The TA's are very helpful.,05/10/2006,1,1.0,,4,It's my life,2.5,2.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
