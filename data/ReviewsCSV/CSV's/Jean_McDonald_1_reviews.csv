N/A,good,good,good,1,21903545,1,,good,5,JOUR420,"Jean is a wonderful friend to have in the journalism world. She will help you with anything, from story ideas to clarifying your prose. She's a master editor and you will learn a lot from her if you try and study. I learned how to learn about my own writing style and what's wrong with it. I will use this skill for the rest of my life. Thanks, Jean!",06/18/2013,5,5.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,person
N/A,good,average,good,1,14389894,1,,good,5,JOUR420,"Jean has real newsroom experience as she works at the News-Gazette so she was very helpful. Quizzes and tests are hard but she uses a curve at the end of the semester. Jean is very personable and friendly, allowed us to actually have fun. She demands that you learn but she's not as demanding as Weinhold was (heard horror stories from friends).",05/02/2008,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,person
