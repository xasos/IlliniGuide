Many other students agree with me when I said she treats her students like they were children. I did appreciate that she provided multiple sources on analyses, however, I feel her treatment of students is much less than professional. She also docked my grade in cases that conflicted her syllabus.",05/23/2012,3,3.0,,2,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Her tests were absolutely impossible, the sight singing for aural skills was ridiculous.  I passed this class my the skin of my teeth ever semester.  My ta's were more helpful.  Her expectations are so high, I don't know how anyone can keep up with them.",09/24/2009,4,4.0,,1,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
