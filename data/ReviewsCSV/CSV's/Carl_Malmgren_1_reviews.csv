Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,25565203,0,,poor,1,MCB403,"absolutely terrible teacher. Unclear ambiguous grading criteria. Everyone is failing... class is just impossible. Papers dont have a clear rubric. u'll get 2 letter grades lower than you expect, and C's on papers if hes feeling nice. never answers questions directly because he ""wants you to think about it"" and gets frustrated when u dont understand",12/06/2015,5,5.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,WD,,people,people

Material is complicated. If you're looking for MCB lab requirement, look elsewhere. terrible teacher, you will struggle. explain fundamental concepts unclearly because he ""wants you to come up w/ the answer""",10/07/2015,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,Not sure yet,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,1,20767511,0,,poor,1,MCB403,"I think Carl is an overall horrible teacher. He doesn't explain things well at all, and the class is very very very unorganized. There is no clear grading systems and for the most of the labs, I feel had easy concepts with much too complicated procedures that are hard to follow. The quizzes aren't too bad but Carl's explanation are just bad.",11/02/2012,4,4.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
N/A,poor,average,average,1,20759880,0,,poor,1,MCB403,He has good intentions but is actually impossible to follow at times. Class is very different from typical MCB labs and is pretty interesting but if you struggle with MCB don't take this class cause Carl isn't so good at answering questions in a comprehensible manner. The grades are based on averages so usually you won't fail.,10/31/2012,2,2.0,,3,Really into it,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
