He is enthusiastic, really helps you appreciate the value of the works we read, and helps you get through the grueling antiguo literature as painlessly as possible.  He will be a friend to you, make you laugh every day, and if you ask him, he will find a way to give out extra credit.  All around a great person.",12/27/2006,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

There's pretty much no homework (like 10 easy assignments the entire semester). He's also very helpful, funny, nice and lets you go early if you ask nicely :)",09/13/2006,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
