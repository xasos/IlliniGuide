The course itself moves too fast, but Ide Sensei is very good. My only wish is that we listened more to her talk in Japanese instead of listening to ourselves. I think that's why the listening on the exams is so tough.",05/02/2007,5,5.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Grades *everything* so you better do the work, but she is a good teacher and very nice.  She also &quot;teaches&quot; more than some of the other Japanese teachers, which is a good thing.  And of course the stories from her college days are priceless ;)",08/10/2006,4,4.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Challenging but fun, a class I never space out in, not bored or idle for a second.  It's a class worth waking up early for. Has a good sense of humor.
