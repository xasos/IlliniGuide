Not Mandatory,good,poor,average,0,26145499,0,,good,4,HSFS340GWS340,"Very easy class, especially if you've taken a GWS class before. The material is common sense. Ramona is unnecessarily strict, especially about phones, and she isn't great at leading discussion, but none of the work was hard. Attendance wasn't required or necessary to do well. Seeing others' final projects was the most interesting part of the class.",03/15/2016,1,1.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Final project was very fun to do & I learned a lot from other student's projects. She is able to subtly share her beliefs with students without pushing or expecting anyone to agree.
