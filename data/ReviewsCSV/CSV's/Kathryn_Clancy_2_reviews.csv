N/A,good,poor,average,0,17639744,0,,average,4,ANTH145,"I took this class (Biology of Human Behavior) because it sounded very interesting. Professor Clancy somehow manages to make every class extremely boring. She loves to hear herself speak, treats students like children, and is overwhelmingly feminist.
