Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,25600581,0,,good,5,MDIA380,Gives off a cool dad vibe. Really knew what he was talking. The class was interesting but a tad repetitive. Only one exam and two 6-page papers. Class is long but you watch documentaries for about half of it. We got out early almost every week. Gave good feedback on papers. Really chill class with a positive environment.,12/09/2015,1,1.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Constantly deviates from the materiallecture to criticize something political, and goes on a ridiculous rant about politics. It is easy to deduce that he is a hardcore liberal.

Two papers, in-class quizzes, and participation/attendance make up your grade completely. Easy to get an A on everything if you follow his formula for movie reviews. 3 CREDIT HOURS for little to no effort.
