Not Mandatory,average,good,poor,0,24903573,0,,poor,2,ACCY405,"Never responds to emails. Away at conferences a lot and has a lot of substitute teachers. Never actually teaches. Uses PowerPoints from previous semesters, but doesn't change the dates on them. Comes unprepared to classes and exams (our exam started 20 minutes late).

He grades super hard and he barely teaches you any material because he is all about discovery learning and learning for ourselves. When we were struggling we were told to wash our face.
