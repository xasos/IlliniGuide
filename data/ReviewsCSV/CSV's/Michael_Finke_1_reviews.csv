N/A,poor,good,poor,1,24311164,0,,poor,1,RUSS115,"For a freshmen level class, it was unnecessarily difficult. If it weren't for his condescending tone when students asked for help on essays and an insane amount of reading, it would have been an enjoyable class. Don't take this class if you expect an A either, I am a straight A student and worked my butt off yet still pulled an unsatisfactory grade",01/20/2015,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person

Come to class with a few good questions. Don't be intimidated by the higher level he teaches at-- it was definitely my favorite class.     Don't be late, and pay attention!

However, Finke turned me away from pursuing anything Russian related again at UIUC. He marked off points just because he didn't agree with your opinion, he'd even mark off correct words and label them as being ""wrong"" despite showing him the dictionary definition.",05/15/2014,5,5.0,,1,It's my life,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people

He assigns interesting texts but in class discussions is very unclear and will tell students that their opinions on a text are wrong. He isn't extremely helpful, I was very excited for his class since I love russ lit but he lacks passion and its a downer",10/21/2010,4,4.0,,1,It's my life,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
