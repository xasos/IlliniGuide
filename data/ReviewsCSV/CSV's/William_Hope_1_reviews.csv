N/A,good,average,good,0,17456067,0,,good,4,LAST170,This was one of the easiest classes I took my freshmen year and also one of the most interesting. Prof. Hope placed lots of emphasis on critical thinking and pretty much the entire class is based on the reading which isn't too hard since he includes focus questions which he uses on the exam.,07/27/2010,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The material is pretty dry and I do no't think it's as easy as everyone says it is. MY t.a. was Luis and he was HILARIOUS!!! It's a good class, just get Luis as your T.A. and READ READ the material!!",11/09/2009,2,2.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,15825353,0,,good,5,LAS170,This guy is awesome and engaging. He's genuinely interested in what he teaches which permeates to the students. I'm not an LAS major but it made me want to take more classes. His tests are very fair but the class requires a good amount of reading... most of the time interesting. TAs are very personable along with William himself. Awesome class!,05/13/2009,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I hardly went to class because complete notes were always available online and his lecturing is useless.
