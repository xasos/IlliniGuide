N/A,good,average,good,0,15097834,0,,good,5,ACE232,Mazzocco is awesome. He makes class fun by cracking jokes and telling relevant stories.  Never gets too far off track.  Very knowledgeable man and a pleasure to talk to.  He really cares about his students and how well they are learning. I would highly recommend a class with him!,12/03/2008,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,average,average,0,14957212,0,,average,3,ACE232,"Class itself is not the easiest, but he does curve, so that's a good thing. It's tough to expect what his tests are, take notes, you probably want to read the chapters too. You go interview a manager, he graded that tough too, but as I said, he curves the class so if you do badly on the tests, don't worry so much about that.",11/07/2008,3,3.0,,3,Meh,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
