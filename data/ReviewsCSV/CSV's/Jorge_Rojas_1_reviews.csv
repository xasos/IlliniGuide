N/A,poor,good,poor,0,17293750,0,,poor,1,ECON420,I'd rate this class as one of the worst in my 4 years at the school. The material is interesting but he just can't teach it. A lot of times he made mistakes in his powerpoints and could not explain the material. He defers from the textbook for some of the concepts he covers which makes things a little difficult. I heard Baer was a good prof though,06/02/2010,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
