N/A,good,average,good,0,11813537,0,,good,4,UP478,"Stacy is a pretty cool professor, although her grading in this class was sort of tough.  Seems like she picked everything apart and was not afraid to give a low grade.  Sort of a useless UP class that SHOULD be a Social Work class.  Not too time consuming though, except for the 2 required weekend trips to East St. Louis.",05/03/2006,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
