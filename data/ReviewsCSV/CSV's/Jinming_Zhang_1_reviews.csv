His answers were usually, &quot;Look in the book.&quot; He would not clarify anything and seemed annoyed with us if we didn't understand something. He knows the content very well, but he is an awful teacher.",01/27/2012,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Perhaps it's because the prof is from a statistics background while everyone else is education and social science. He's too math-oriented, and quite frankly, I didn't learn anything. His teaching style is quite ambiguous and everyone would leave the class frustrated!",02/20/2010,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
