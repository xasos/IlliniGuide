N/A,good,poor,good,0,25111167,0,,good,5,AFST222,"I took this class online as an elective and couldn't be more happy with my decision.  Quizzes are 5 questions, Expect a 100 if you do the discussions on time, online tests are fairly easy and the final paper was also easy!  Basically as long as you are doing your stuff on time you can expect an A! ",08/11/2015,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people

Easy grades. lecture outlines online so lecture can be skipped, but def. go to discussion. Readings aren't too bad, and only help for discussion grade&papers, not exams.

Good class if you want to learn about Africa in general, but it wasn't really modern.. at least not in the everyday use of the word. Prof. Barro cares about students, is fair, and interesting. I wish she taught us more about her continent as it is now and not years ago!",12/16/2009,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Test were great because any information used in class or discussion could be used for the classes.
