N/A,average,good,average,0,21508427,0,,poor,2,CS440,"Very disorganized professor. I sincerely doubt he even writes his own lectures as his lectures often give the impression that he's seeing the slides for the first time. He jumps around the slides a lot, and it becomes very difficult to follow his point.   The MPs for the class are pretty interesting but they require a lot of time and effort.",04/09/2013,5,5.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,poor,0,20515411,0,,poor,2,CS440,"Nice guy, but completely unorganized during lecture. Jumps around slides a lot. Clearly no preparation. Late to office hours sometimes. Lecture seldom follow the book, so it is often difficult to find out what to study. HW is extremely long (10-20 hours to complete) but usually assigned every other week.",07/25/2012,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
