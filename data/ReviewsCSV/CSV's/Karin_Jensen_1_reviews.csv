Mandatory,average,good,average,0,25824122,0,,poor,2,BIOE202,"She was very knowledgeable about the lab protocols, and learning important techniques in cell culturing is something I'll definitely take away from this class. However, she is not very effective in communicating with her students about her expectations on the lab reports. She is a very stringent grader and did not provide meaningful feedback.",12/25/2015,4,4.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people

She is credible; she has performed all of the protocols in industry before and knows the material. However, sometimes there is an issue with clear communication. She knows so much that she doesn't know how to address students' questions and confuses people even more.",12/24/2015,4,4.0,,4,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
