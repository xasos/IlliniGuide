All the info you need is taught in class and he always gives plenty of examples. Tests and quizzes are hard so you can not slack off, I wouldn't recommend missing class. Textbook was so expensive and I never even used it!",06/13/2013,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He writes out his notes on the whiteboard every day rather than lecture notes which can be a drag. Test/quizzes are hard. If you actually work the in class problems/&quot;suggested&quot; homework problems you'll do well in the class. 5-10% curve, I got a B with minimal effort & senioritis.",07/05/2011,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
