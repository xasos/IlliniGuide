Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25080286,0,,good,4,ENC1101,"One of the best professors I've ever had. Very lucky if you have him, he's funny and makes learning fun. Always gives feedback,  follow the rubric and you will do good. Occasionally gives you pop quizzes on the reading but it's so easy because all you have to do is read and take good notes. He's not a tough grader at all. ",07/30/2015,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,people,people

Can sound pretentious, but he's aware of it and it's just his persona. Which is fairly entertaining.",01/22/2014,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A+,,people,people
Mandatory,good,average,good,0,22720278,0,,good,4,CW200,"Sean has extensive knowledge on poem and story writing, but without a textbook I think it was a little hard for him to get some info across now and then and make it stick with the us. That said, the class was incredibly open ended and he offered all kinds of help on his own time. I'd jump off a bridge for the guy because he legitimately cared.",01/08/2014,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people
Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,22283702,0,,poor,1,CW200,You literally have 2 write a paper EVERY WEEK for this class. 14 papers. Plus the final and a lengthy 12pg self analysis paper at the end of the semester on top of a final. Professor talks like a textbook and then when asked to clarify just talks more like a textbook. Unless you wanna be a burnt out within in 2 weeks of this class avoid it,11/08/2013,5,5.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,C,,people,people
N/A,poor,good,average,0,22247716,0,,poor,1,CW200,I honestly hated this class. He makes you write basically the same response paper each week for the ENTIRE semester. On top of that you have a self analysis paper AND a final exam where you must know authors names and titles of work throughout the entire semester. He talks at you like you're a PHD student and has to be right 100% of the time.,11/03/2013,4,4.0,,3,Low,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
