He's an average professor AT BEST.  he obviously is very passionate and comes up with creative lessons, but there wasn't much content behind any lecture.  they were pointless.  and so are the group essay exams.  i've learned nothing i didn't already know.  sorry to break hearts.",12/14/2010,1,1.0,,4,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
