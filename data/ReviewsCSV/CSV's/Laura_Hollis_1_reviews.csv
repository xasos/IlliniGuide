Papers increase in difficulty and length, which also means they are worth more. Exams were trivial if you were attentive in class and leisurely read the book.

That being said, attending class each day was a joy. Hollis clearly is an expert in her field and makes learning the material a breeze.

All of the information taught is relevent and I would take any other class taught by her. The grading is not that hard and the tests are kind of easy. Easy B, but an A if you work a little.",12/15/2005,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
