I put more work into this class then I did for Organic Chem and mcb250 combined (both of which I got A+'s in) and I still got an A- even after studying for the final for a full month.

You go on the dates on the syllabus for movie days, turn in papers for those, and test days. Other than that, you won't need to go to class because she is incomprehensible beyond your wildest dreams. It's no use trying to understand. A nice lady, but not qualified to teach.",11/16/2009,2,2.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I can understand for many American People why she would be hard to understand, but ALSO as an INTERNATIONAL student whose lived in 7 different countries...I CANNOT UNDERSTAND A WORD SHE SAYS.
