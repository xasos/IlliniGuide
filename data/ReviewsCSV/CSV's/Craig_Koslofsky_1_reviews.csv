Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,23774373,1,,good,4,HIST200,"This was an introductory class about doing historical research. At first, all the reading, studying, and writing seemed daunting. But he is such a good professor that the information simply came to me and the 15-page paper almost wrote itself. He is very passionate and willing to help. Just make sure to read and keep up to date on assignments.",11/09/2014,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,person,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,21917313,1,,good,5,HIST100,"Koslofsky is a really great professor but this class is so broad in topics that you don't really get to see him in his element. Overall, class is pretty straightforward with essays and tests. If history isn't your thing, I don't recommend it, but otherwise really covers the basics of global history enough to pique interest.",06/23/2013,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

Lecture is beneficial, as he expands on those terms which will help you on exams. He makes the course much more complicated than it has to be.  REALLY BORING LECTURES.

This class has a large research paper and he is very willing to help. Lots of reading, but no more than any other history class. he's extremely intelligent and passionate about what he does, and humorous as well so he's not just a dud professor.",10/12/2012,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

N/A,average,average,average,1,16102421,0,,poor,2,HIST141,Lectures are extremely boring and rarely relate to what is given on the midterm and final exams. Writing a 750 word essay every 2 weeks in a 100 level class and your grade in the hands of your TA makes it worse.

We had to write five 750-word essays for the class, only one midterm, and discussions were mandatory for a good grade, as 25% of the final grade was participation.
