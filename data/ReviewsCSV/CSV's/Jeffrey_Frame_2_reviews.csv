Labs are not as helpful for exams as they were for 303 so rely heavily on lecture slides for study material. On the first exam he asked us something he grazed over in class which was very disappointing. It was one line on one slide in one lecture and it showed up on the exam - 6 points wasted.

ATMS 100 is quite easy and I took it only for the A since there is only crossover with ATMS 120 & 201. Still he delivers the material very well and also his ability to spew out puns is insane and great.
