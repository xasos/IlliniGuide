You will not care at all about this class. You have quizzes every week, which include doing powerpoint discussions and readings before the class. When you are actually in class you don't do any lecturing and it is all these worksheets.",11/20/2013,3,3.0,,1,Meh,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
