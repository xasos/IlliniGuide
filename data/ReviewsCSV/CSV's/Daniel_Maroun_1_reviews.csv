This was the first French class I took here and I thought it was extremely easy; I never studied and still got A's on all the tests, but I think my French level is slightly above this class. Overall though, Dan is so much fun as a teacher, probably one of my favorites here! Love!",04/24/2013,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,21457872,0,,good,5,FR207,Knows French inside and out. Explains incredibly clearly. Extremely fun. Has a lot of interesting topics to talk about. So friendly and approachable. Great with people. 207 requires attention to detail but in my opinion his tests are easy if you study. I had no problem getting a good grade but my French level may be slightly above this course.,03/28/2013,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
