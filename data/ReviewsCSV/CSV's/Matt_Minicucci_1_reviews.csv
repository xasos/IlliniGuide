He seems really chill, but at the same time seems like he has really high expectations for the students. I felt like my comments were never good enough or ever met his expectations. I kind of feel like he would judge me on what I said.",12/16/2015,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

He seems to love his job and he is always there for you if you need something. The atmosphere in class is great and that's why I think you learn a lot without bein aware of it.
