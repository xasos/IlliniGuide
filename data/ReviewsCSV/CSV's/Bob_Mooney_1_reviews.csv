He would ignore the syllabus until the last minute; we had to complete a project in one weekend that other studios had two weeks to complete.  As mentioned, he does try to get students to drop; he attempted to get me to drop three weeks before the class ended.

He responses only to ass-kissing, so if you are stuck in his class just say &quot;Prof. Mooney, that was so funny&quot; or &quot;Prof. Mooney you're the coolest!&quot; and you'll get an A.

He designates at least one &quot;goat&quot; in each class that he will drive out. He is the most unprofessional, unoriginal, untalented hack that I have ever met in the field of architecture.
