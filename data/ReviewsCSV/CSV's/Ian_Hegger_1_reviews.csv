Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25915259,0,,good,5,REL101,He is an outstanding teacher. His lectures may be on confusing topics but he explains the topic in detail and makes it crystal clear. He is relaxed on homework as long as you are able to make a good contribution to class discussion. He is unbiased in his teaching on religion and is one of my all time favorite teachers.,01/10/2016,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Don't really need the textbook. Curves so class average is an 80%, but people usually do well anyways. Curves usually boost you by 1/2 a letter grade (i.e  curve will put you from a B to a B+). I recommend this class",01/13/2014,2,2.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The class is simple, listen, participate, study for the exams and you will get an A. Ian is excellent, he knows philosophy, he learns from criticism, challenges you intellectually, and helps you open your mind.

N/A,good,average,good,0,21129011,0,,good,5,PHIL101,This course teaches you a lot about philosophy. Beware that it is a history of philosophy course so you focus on how philosophy evolved. The class could be repetitive at times but as a first year teacher he did very well and the class got better as the semester went on. You also begin to see how what your learning is useful later in the semester.,12/19/2012,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Tests were very hard, he never gave a good idea of what was on the test. average tests scores on all the tests were 60-65%, and when explaining why he made a philosophy 101 class so hard he said grades are to easy.

The tests are extremely difficult. However, no work is required for the class aside from reading so in that sense the class is easy. That also makes it harder to get a good grade though since your grade depends almost completely on exams.",10/31/2012,3,3.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
