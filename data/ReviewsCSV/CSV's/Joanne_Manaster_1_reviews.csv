There were 3-4 lessons a week which included quizzes, readings, and the lectures, followed by an exam from 2-6 on fridays. I always had to have a conflict exam scheduled and Joanne was extremely helpful and never seemed annoyed or bothered by questions.",01/04/2016,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people

Thus, she made videos to limit the time she needed to spend inside of the classroom. When she did stay, she showed irrelevant videos that wasted time and left without answering questions.

You'll have to study really hard for quizzes and exams for this 2 hour course, however, you will learn a lot.  Joanne is funny and easygoing.  It's not easy to pull off an A, but I studied hard and did.  Good Luck",12/13/2006,4,4.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
