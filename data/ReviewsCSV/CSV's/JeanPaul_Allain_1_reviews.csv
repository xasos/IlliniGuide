There were questions on the exams that were discussed in class, but not on the slides, so you definitely wanted to go to class. You could tell Prof Allain didn't write his own slides or tests and gave us incorrect information. Too much work for 2 credit hours.

Firstly, the book which was required was hardly used while the recommend book was constantly used.  I HIGHLY recommend getting the Friendberg book.  Secondly, JP can be a bit slow in getting things back.  Other than that, he was a fine professor.",05/23/2014,4,4.0,,4,Meh,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
