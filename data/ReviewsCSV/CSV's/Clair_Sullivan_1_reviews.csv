Not Mandatory,good,average,good,4,23306938,1,,good,5,NPRE451,"Professor Sullivan was the best professor I ever had at UIUC.  She is always attentive to the needs of her students, and she is very relatable.  She makes a point of getting the know the students at a personal level, and for that, she deserves an award.  Her class is tough, but very doable.  I highly recommend her as a professor!",05/23/2014,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A-,,person,people
