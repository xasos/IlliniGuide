I really didn't learn much at all from the class since you're taught only to regurgitate information. I don't agree with his teaching style. Many times I felt the quizzes were 'gotcha' questions. You have to read a chapter of 25+ terms but only two are on the quiz. Lame.,08/25/2011,3,3.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
