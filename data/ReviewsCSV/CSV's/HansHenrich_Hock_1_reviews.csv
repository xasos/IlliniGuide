Mandatory,average,poor,good,0,23422951,3,,good,3,LING240,"Hock is a great guy, very funny and personable. He's an easy grader (at least for the honors course I had him in) and easy to talk to and get to know. His lectures were sometimes unorganized and tended to be VERY repetitive, but it was a very laid back course, and readings and assignments were really light. HHH is wonderful.",07/04/2014,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people

Attendance was mandatory, but it used the same material in the book. The assignments were busy work. The grading never made sense because they claimed to be holding us to a higher standard and then curving. Easy, fun class, just can be frustrating.",01/11/2011,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I like the way the course is structured because I find myself focus more on learning rather than worrying about my grades all the time.

Im pretty convinced you have to actually try to get less than a B, not because the class is easy, but because he gives so many chances to improve grades.
