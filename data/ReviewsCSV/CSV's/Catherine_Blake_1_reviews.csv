N/A,poor,good,poor,1,18424679,0,,poor,1,LIS490,Professor Blake is extremely knowledgeable about databases but her teaching is sub par. Lectures are disorganized and often full of errors. The learning process in the class is a guessing game rather than a learning experience. Collaboration with classmates is strongly discouraged.

She has personal conventions that differ from the text book and you are giged points for doing things the text book way.
