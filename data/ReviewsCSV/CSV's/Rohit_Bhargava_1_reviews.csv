N/A,average,good,average,0,11812396,0,,average,3,BIOE201,Lots of work and hard grading is the story of this class.  Basically is the course work of 3 seperate classes all put together into 1.  Bhargava sees undergrads the same as grad students and has the same expectations.  Kinda ridiculous but probably going to be a useful class in the long run,05/03/2006,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
