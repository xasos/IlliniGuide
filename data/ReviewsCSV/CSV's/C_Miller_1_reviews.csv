Exams are straightforward, directly from the slides on DNA&amino acids; important to grasp major concepts&apply them. Lectures were very boring but it was fun watching him try to use iclickers & constantly fail. Consider dropping if you don't do well with Miller bc Farrands exams are very ambiguous.",12/20/2010,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The quizzes and exams are not hard if you put in study time. The first exam is pretty much all amino acids and their pka's. The second exam is simple stuff DNA stuff. If you stuggle, i would suggest dropping since Farrand is alot harder.",08/13/2010,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

I actually liked Dr. Farrand better, during the second half of the semester, because at least he seemed more enthusiastic. If you hope to learn sufficiently from him, expect to have to go to office hours a lot. =[",08/12/2010,5,5.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He is extremely condescending and arrogant in lecture and does not fully explain concepts at all.  His use of PowerPoint is never-ending, but it is completely ineffective.
