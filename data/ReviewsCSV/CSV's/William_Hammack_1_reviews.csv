Mandatory,good,average,good,0,22659876,1,,good,5,CHBE221,"Awesome lecturer.  Engaging and funny.  He came into office hours a few times and was great. You can tell he really does enjoy working with students.  However, exams were incredibly difficult compared to material covered in class. But hey, that's just part of being an engineer.  Overall I recommend him.",12/26/2013,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

Exams are not related to how well you study, Extremely hard. Before the final we are told the final is multiply choice, but one day before final he said the questions are short answer question. what he is thinking?!",12/20/2013,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,person

The class is highly disorganized, the professor is very detached from the students, and grades received on exams are seldom related to how much time was spent studying or learning the material.

N/A,good,poor,good,0,14485799,0,,good,4,CHBE101,This is the easiest science gen ed on campus and no one knows about it.  Quizzes are relatively easy and based on a 40pg reading packet.  Most of your grade is dependent on group projects.  Hammack is awesome and most of the time we were let out a half hour early.

Literally about 5-10 minutes of homework a week. The entire reading for the semester consists of a 40 page packet. I honestly had harder classes in 5th grade.
