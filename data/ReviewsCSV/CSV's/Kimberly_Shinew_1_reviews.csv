Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24254525,0,,good,5,RST100,All tests are scantron so there's no confusion with grading. She is nice and will bring in your old tests if you want to look over your errors. Three iClicker questions EVERY CLASS. You COULD pass without them but they are a great grade cushion.

N/A,good,average,good,0,18819052,0,,good,5,RST100,GREAT teacher. You can tell she enjoys teaching because she really gets the class involved and is easy going. She makes you really understand what you're learning and this is a pretty easy class if you go. Read the book before class because she grades you on in-class i-clicker questions. That's what got me because I couldn't remember what I read.,07/14/2011,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
