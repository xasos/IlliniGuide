Have to read two easy books, but we go over them in class. Got to connect with other people too. Cool class.",05/03/2012,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

You'll get to connect with other students (mostly black), but people from other races actually make the class a lot more interesting! It's an easy A, and offers over 150 extra credit points!

MAKES STUDENTS DRESS UP FOR CLASS ON RANDOM DAYS. QUIZZES AND TESTS BASED OFF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN AMERICAN MOVIES.
