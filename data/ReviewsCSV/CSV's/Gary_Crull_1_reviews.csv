N/A,average,average,average,0,21071243,0,,good,3,KIN260,Gary teaches a few KIN courses and he knows what he is talking about; so he likes to talk about it A LOT. If you get over this you can enjoy the course and he's a pretty chill guy. If you try and have issues he's an easy grader and understands; if I had to choose between Gary and someone else it'd always be Gary.,12/14/2012,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
