Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25843436,0,,good,4,IB204,"Dr. Heath is a very good lecturer. She doesn't read off he slides and knows the content very well. She can be confusing when she lectures on LacZ development. She does give funny and great examples. The content is a bit difficult to understand. There's lots of I-Clicker questions, so attend lecture! Also, there is assigned seating which is a drag.",12/29/2015,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,people,people
Not Mandatory,good,average,good,1,25388433,0,,good,5,IB204,"I really liked Dr. Heath. She was definitely my favorite lecturer this semester and sh'e really funny! She's also extremely friendly and is pretty good at elaborating on her ppt slides. This class was fairly challenging for me but by far not the hardest a bio student has to take. The material can be difficult, not Dr. Heath. Lots of i-clickers.",11/11/2015,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person

She also knows her stuff, never reading directly off slides, and being quick to offer examples. Her class is moderate in difficulty, but I struggled more than some others in terms of understanding the material.",11/11/2015,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,people,person
N/A,good,average,good,2,23671166,0,,good,4,IB204,"Dr. Heath is among the coolest and nicest professors I've had at UIUC. Most of the time she's clear and happily explains any questions. The exams are challenging but not terrible and any work given in the class is truly helpful, not busy-work. Attendance is taken daily through i-clicker. IB 204 switches professors after the second exam. ",10/20/2014,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
