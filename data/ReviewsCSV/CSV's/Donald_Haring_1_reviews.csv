This means that you can only speak to him in ASL, which can sometimes be difficult. Overall, he is a really nice guy and as long as you don't get on his bad side you will do fine.",01/16/2015,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,person,person

He was quite intimidating at first, but is so great at explaining things and making sure all the students understand the concepts before moving forward.  You still need to put in some time to study for quizzes and tests, but as long as you put in the time, you will do well!",05/24/2014,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,person

Makes the class fun and makes you want to learn more. All quizzes & exams are easy if you study a little.

Haring really tries his best to make the class upbeat and fun. Quizzes are easy w/ a little studying, and the weekly assignments aren't difficult either.
