Not Mandatory,good,average,good,1,23325352,0,,good,5,PSY420,"Probably one of the best professors I've had at UIUC. She loves what she teaches and you can definitely tell, which is a great environment for learning. She is really funny and the way she lectures is very conversational, which, I thin, is easier to follow. She gets off topic a lot but somehow finds her way back with that as her example.
