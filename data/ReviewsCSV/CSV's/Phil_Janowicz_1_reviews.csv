PHIL, and he hadn't even passed his PHD defense.  He didn't do anything and just let the TAs do all of the work.

If you expect to BS your way through and not give it any effort, you will probably not do so great. Phil was always there and open for questions if you needed help",07/12/2010,5,5.0,,5,Low,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,good,poor,0,17257754,0,,poor,2,CHEM232,He was completely useless. He offered 4 exam times for each of the three exams for the semester but never changed any of the 4 so the avgs. for the people who took the test on the first day were so much lower than people that took the same test the second day. People cheated their way through this class and he did nothing about it. He was awful.,05/23/2010,4,4.0,,1,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He is a joke and basically, he doesn't teach the class.  No one teaches the class...it's a free-for-all that you have to figure out on your own.
