I went to office hours a few times and he wasn't that helpful and he seemed kind of angry when i showed up. One benefit is the class had a gigantic curve (somehow i got an A- and i didnt know how to solve boundry value problems).",08/04/2005,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

If he tests you on something besides the homework, he will go probably over it thouroughly in class.  Not the best teacher I've had, but MATH 385 is tough to learn on your own, so go to class.",07/19/2005,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

 Polim-yoo --&gt; Polynomial
 Geraboo --&gt; General
