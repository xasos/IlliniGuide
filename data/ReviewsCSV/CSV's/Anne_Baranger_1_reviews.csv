She reads off her slides and teaches you things that mostly aren't on the test.  Then on the test she includes questions you have never seen before or concepts she didn't discuss fully.

This class was the easiest class i had first semester freshman year and I'm not a chem major or anything like that. I'm actually a CS major which is in the opposite direction.
