Mandatory,poor,good,average,0,23308774,0,,poor,1,PS480,"Interesting material, often felt like a history class. Quizzes on readings every class--but sometimes forgets the quiz and/or pages of it. Tests and quizzes are very difficult (requires specific fact memorization), but class is curved somehow at the end. Nice intelligent man, but very unorganized and somewhat scatterbrained.",05/24/2014,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,B,,people,people

Grading is weird, sometimes I got good grade doing nothing and sometimes bad grade doing a lot of work. Overall he has a good personality and the classes are worth going.",05/01/2013,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,poor,average,0,21641726,0,,average,3,NPRE481,"This professor is awful. Half the class focused on grammar (thinks like subject-verb agreement that I understood in 2nd grade), and the rest on him rambling in an extremely dry manner about politics. He spent a lot of time fumbling around on the computer in class, and we spent WAY too much time on punctuation, etc. We had an exam on bibliographies",04/30/2013,1,1.0,,2,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

However, the final essay for the exam, examines an analytical approach to an energy security issue. A complete 180 from everything else learned in class.
