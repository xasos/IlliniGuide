Mandatory,good,average,good,1,26378587,0,,good,5,ACCY304,"Greatest accounting professor I've had at UIUC-hands down! His lectures are engaging, funny, and applicable to the real world. He's got a ton of experience to give insight on the topics he speaks about. He also emailed me after a midterm congratulating me on how well I was doing in the class. Most conceptual based accounting class I've ever had.",04/26/2016,3,3.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person

The class is strongly centered around group discussion, so be prepared before class by doing the readings (which are very easy).  If you come in late, he will call on you more frequently.  Tests we're the same across all of 304, but were easy yet graded toughly.",04/12/2016,2,2.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,B+,,people,person
