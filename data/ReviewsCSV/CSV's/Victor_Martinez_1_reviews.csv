He is insanely knowledgeable on what he's talking about.  TA does a lot of the more personal stuff, but he is a wonderful professor, especially in the lecture environment.  Tests can be murderous though; memorize IDs as you go.",10/21/2006,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He is also very passionate about his subject matter & you can see that when he teaches the class. He tries to help his students succeed & is always willing to help students improve their grades.

The tests are extremely difficult, but the best thing to do is to study with friends and make flash cards for all the pieces he goes over in lecture (I went from a 79 to a 94 between tests, and the second one was harder).",11/26/2005,4,4.0,,5,Meh,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
