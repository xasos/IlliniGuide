N/A,poor,good,poor,0,12983305,0,,poor,1,LAST170,She has no idea how to teach a class like this.  Assumes everyone knows just as much about latin american culture as she does prior to taking the course.  The lectures and assignments are pointless and do not really correspond to what is on the exams. The TA's are terrible.
