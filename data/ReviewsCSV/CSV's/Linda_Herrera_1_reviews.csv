Mandatory,good,good,good,0,26346282,0,online,good,4,EPS550,"Dr. Herrera provides a rigorous, while extremely interesting course.  She is insightful and well-respected by students.  I was intimidated to take a course with her as she has such a powerful reputation, but she was incredibly kind and understanding.  She does not give work that isn't meaningful.
