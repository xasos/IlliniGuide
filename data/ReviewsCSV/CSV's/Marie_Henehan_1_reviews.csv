In a matter of 5 minutes, the topic of lecture fluctuates wildly between unrelated topics often not pertaining whatsoever to the assigned readings.

Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,25479571,0,,poor,1,PS313,Henehan is extremely intelligent and knowledgeable but makes it very difficult to succeed in her class. Other raters were correct that she rambles and often goes over the hour and a half lecture time she is allotted. It's also correct that it is very history oriented and the only students that succeed at all came in with vast background knowledge.,11/23/2015,5,5.0,,2,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,2,23514118,0,,poor,1,PS313,She rambles. It's confusing. And she expects you to have detailed background knowledge on all US War involvements.

She is not much of a listener just prefers to talk and talk. PS 491 is the internship class, my internship was awesome but the class is way too much work.

She started giving random quizzes and only informs us after 10 the night before and will forget to attach the readings to the emails. It feels like she intentionally makes the class a nightmare.

She wants her students to learn, and will go off on a tangent if there is a good discussion to be had.

It will take an hour of rambling just to get to the information you need to know and then she doesn't even cover it all so you get behind. Grading takes forever. All the learning you do is done by reading she doesn't teach any information. Worst professor ev,12/13/2009,4,4.0,,2,Meh,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
