While there is the occasional pop quiz, she loves knowing her students read and they're never hard. She's super funny and some of the things she lectures on will leave you mind-blown. She goes above and beyond teaching the classroom material.",03/16/2016,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
Mandatory,average,average,average,1,25829407,1,,average,2,LLS238,I could not deal with Mireya. The class was on social justice issues and she pretended that she knew what she was talking about when she really did not. I can honestly say I walked away from the class knowing nothing. I ended up getting a B because I didn't do some side project she wanted. I wouldn't take another class with her even if I was paid.,12/26/2015,2,2.0,,3,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,person,person
