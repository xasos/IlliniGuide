Quizzes and papers aren't graded that strictly. Only negative, the first 20 min/80min class spent recapping the last class. Very redundant.",10/28/2015,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Has the ability to deftly navigate the issues he teaches (can satisfactorily answer almost any question thrown at him) as well as the ability to handle periphery issues. Very organized.

I wasn't a fan of his grading style, I thought it was somewhat arbitrary and I'm not sure what else I could have reasonably done to improve my grade. I should have gone into office hours to ask more specifically what he was looking for on papers.  ",05/30/2015,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,person,people
