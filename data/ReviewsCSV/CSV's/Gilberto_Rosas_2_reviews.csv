The final was 50% of the grade, and midterm was 40%, the other 10% was for a term paper that he didn't even grade.

N/A,average,average,average,1,17167727,0,,average,3,ANTH103,Incredibly unprofessional. It is standard procedure for him to show up 5-10 minutes late for class and let you out 15minutes early. He has long random pauses during his lectures. Could not work a computer if his life depended upon it. Review sheets are awful.
