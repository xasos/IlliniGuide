N/A,poor,average,poor,0,15881691,0,,poor,1,PHIL102,"This class was easy, but it was completely horrible.  Nathalie did not know how to teach and a lot of the discussions incorporated material that was entirely irrelevant to the course.  We want to learn logic, not watch random clips of stupid movies.  Even though the class was easy, she was often cold, condescending, heartless, and unclear.",05/21/2009,2,2.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The key is to keep on asking questions: DON'T BE AFRAID! She may seem intimidating, but she will never embarrass you. Formal logic is really tough, especially if you're not a math person and are not used to the material. Pop Quizzes are frequent!",06/01/2008,4,4.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She is not a good teacher, not helpful, and the subject is SO incredibly boring. The best way to describe her is condescending.

She doesn't have much to work with, granted, but she just can't explain things very well or interestingly.

She definitely favors other students in class and doesn't like giving one-on-one attention (especially during her office hours). She doesn't curve the class, so don't bother taking hers!",08/14/2006,5,5.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,3,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
