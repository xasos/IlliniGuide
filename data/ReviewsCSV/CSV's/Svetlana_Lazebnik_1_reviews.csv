Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,25797679,2,,poor,1,CS440,Class covers some extremely interesting concepts. Svetlana does a piss poor job of explaining them in lecture. Her lecture slides consist of condensed material from a textbook and she literally reads the slides aloud in class.

N/A,poor,good,poor,2,22566222,0,,poor,1,CS440,Quite a poor professor. She has interesting research but has no clue how to properly lecture. Slides are verbatim from the book as are the exams. Does not help at office hours and has a terrible laugh. Keeps track of students attendance mentally… and calls you by name.
