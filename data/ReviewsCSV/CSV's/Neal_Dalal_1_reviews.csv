Went in for office hours once, and he left 10 minutes into them even though i had tons of questions on the homework. He expected us to know far too much information before coming into that class. Also he says ""okay"" every two seconds. Nothing really wrong with that, i just found it very annoying.",04/30/2014,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,WD,,people,people

Homeworks often require derivations, and don't give a great understanding to the concepts involved. PPT slides are often less thorough than required for HW and require research to complete the HW. Exams are fair using concepts from PPT",04/19/2013,4,4.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

It's a decent class if you understand everything the first time, off the bat, but if you don't, good luck. He doesn't give back the homeworks, nor does he ever do what he says he will. He's just useless as a teacher.",03/11/2013,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
