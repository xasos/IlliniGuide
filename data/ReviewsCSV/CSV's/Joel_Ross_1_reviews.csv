Very interesting guy, and his work is amazing! He will help when needed & grades your art honestly based on effort, concept, and craft. Craft is where most people fall, I think.

I think about him day and night, and I would love nothing more than to break up he and his wife...not really, he is an adorable father.  Um, he's a good professor, too.  Fun to talk to...he really is a mix of Ben Stein, Harrison Ford and Simon Cowell.
