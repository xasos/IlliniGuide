The exams are actually hard, you really should go to class, and he grades BOGUS on the quizzes. Don't take this class because you heard it was easy! But if you're interested in the subject, go for it. He reads off lecture slides and can't really answer questions.

N/A,good,average,average,0,14528177,0,,good,4,MCB250,really nice guy. Pretty laid back and easy to understand. His tests are much easier than Cronan's (who teaches the first half of the class). Reading over the notes helps alot for exams. Book use isnt necessary but can help if you space out in class or need a review of what was said in class,05/27/2008,2,2.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
