N/A,average,average,average,0,26044606,0,,good,3,PSYCH224,"Interesting class, although tricky if you don't have any background in cognitive psychology yet. No papers, and attendance isn't taken (although I'd recommend it). Expectation is to go to T.A. for help before meeting with the professor. Four multiple choice exams, and the lowest score gets dropped. Good preparation for more advanced psych classes.",02/10/2016,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Attendance isn't mandatory, but you'll want to be there for every lecture. Memorize every detail of every power point slide - there are a lot of tricky questions on exams. Quizzes are gimme points - they are online and allow you unlimited tries. Extra credit available.",03/27/2015,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,person

The material is interesting, and the tests aren't bad as long as you go to review sessions and do the study guides. Would recommend attending because some in-class examples are on the exam and aren't clear in the lecture slides.",12/20/2014,2,2.0,,4,It's my life,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,people

As long as you know what's on the slides, you're golden for the exams. Crack open the book every once and awhile for the quizzes or clarification. Lectures were interesting and easy to listen to.

Not Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,22676477,0,,good,5,PSYC224,"How to get an A in this course: attend lecture, do study guides before review day, review lectures before exams.  Not necessary to take notes in lecture, but attendance is important as slides can be really confusing if you didn't hear her explain it.  Textbook not necessary, too much extraneous information and no exam questions taken from the text",12/30/2013,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people

All you need to do for exams is memorize slides.  If you go to class, this should be an easy A because she uses her in class examples on the exam.
