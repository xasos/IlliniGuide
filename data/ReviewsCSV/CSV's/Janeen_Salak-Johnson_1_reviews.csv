Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,26291518,0,,good,5,ANSC101,I personally think Dr. Johnson is a great lecturer and teacher. She looks at all sides of the spectrum when discussing contemporary issues. People don't see this probably because the truth isn't what they want to hear. She is clearly passionate about what she does in animal behavior. One of her cons is that her lectures are kind of lengthy.,04/13/2016,1,1.0,,3,N/A,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

She gives a lot of busy work, which can be hard to keep up with at times.  She also comes across as being rude sometimes, especially if you don't agree with her.

She also does not bother to tell you about some of the assignments, so if you don't look at Compass online, you will not even know about them.
