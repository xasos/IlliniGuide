He would give some basic suggestions on how to improve our stories, but ultimately it was up to us what we did with them, as it should be. I didn't feel as if I could actually express my true thoughts or opinions in his class and to him, which is a shame since it was a workshopping class.

He says ""I liked the story a lot"" after every workshop, which gives that comment no weight. He made an exception for someone who didn't deserve it, so he's also a pushover but I'm not convinced he will push you to become a better writer. In his class, that's really on you.",02/03/2015,1,1.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

While his syllabus lays out harsh rules that promise an engaging class, he lets the students get away with almost anything. If you want your writing to improve, don't take creative writing with Philip Graham.",05/03/2013,1,1.0,,1,Really into it,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people

I was a bruised writer for years until I taught in a classroom. Now I get it & am grateful for his direct, to-the-point, criticism.
