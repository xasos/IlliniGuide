PSYC100 test questions are directly from the book material, but you should go to every class to make sure you don't miss quizzes or assignments.

His lectures are pretty interesting, but the material is very dry and despite what the book may say, IS mostly common sense. A requirement for Business majors, like an easier version of BA 310. The midterm was really easy if you put in a moderate level of studying. Reading the book actually helps.",10/24/2006,1,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
