N/A,good,average,average,0,19140839,0,,good,4,ARTF103,Tammie is a solid teacher but her knowledge about some aspects of materials are some what low. It isn't a tough class assuming you have done 3-d work before. I recommend it the projects are easy and the class was relaxing.,11/01/2011,2,2.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,good,good,average,1,16248825,0,,good,4,ARTF103,Very hard teacher.  You'll probably get her as one of your 5 week deign teachers.  Expects masterpieces from first  year students.  Very nit-picky.  Also make you buy tons of stuff and sometimes its wasted.  Spent bout $100 in the class out of own pocket.  Avoid if possible.,10/18/2009,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
