N/A,good,average,good,0,18645449,0,,good,4,ASTRO100,His tests are HARD and the final is HARD. I got an A in the class because he doesn't give +/- and he curves his class by a little (880/1000 is an A). I expected this class to be an easy A but if I were to take it again I would NEVER because it stressed me to much not going if I was going to get an A or not. take Dunne NOT him.,05/21/2011,3,3.0,,5,Low,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
