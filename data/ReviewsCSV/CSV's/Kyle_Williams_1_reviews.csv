The discussion-based nature of the class allows for a more critical understanding of texts and the way the relate to broad themes. I thought medieval english would be painful but he made it enjoyable for the most part. Pay attention to what he says AND what he writes.",12/14/2011,2,2.0,,4,Meh,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,average,poor,0,18998497,0,,poor,2,ENGL,"Avoid Williams. He reads off notes during class and rambles quite aimlessly. The lecture content is not insightful at all, and he often spells things wrong or conjures up words that do not exist. Yes, he is funny sometimes, but the class is very boring since none of the stuff he talks about is engaging. Stay away if you don't want to waste money",09/14/2011,2,2.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He loves to talk, so sometimes lecture got kind of dull. Zombie themed class is fun, watch great movies for points and discuss them.
