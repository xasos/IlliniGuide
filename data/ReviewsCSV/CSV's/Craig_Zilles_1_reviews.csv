The class did seem to suffer from a lack of communication at times.  However, I screwed up on an exam by incorrectly submitting part of it, and Craig allowed me to do a makeup assignment as to not ruin my grade.",01/09/2016,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,person

Not only that, we didn't really have much time to do SPIMBOT. Also, the last midterm was ridiculously hard (it's 20% of your grade) and studying from just course materials was not sufficient.",12/30/2015,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A-,,person,people

Then, he ruins your grade on a last test worth 10% more than the final. Which he follows up by not telling you any information about what's on/the format of the final and you inevitably fail that.
