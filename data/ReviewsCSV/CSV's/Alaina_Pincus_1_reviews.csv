N/A,average,good,average,0,18882951,0,,poor,2,BTW250,Undoubtedly one of the worst professors I've ever had in college; had her for the online BTW 250 section. She is extremely condescending and sometimes outright rude to her students; has somewhat of an arrogant attitude and offers a lot of criticism without much actual advice. Revision advice often very vague. Would never take another class with her,08/04/2011,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She also said you get 30% off your final grade if you miss more than 4 days of class, which I did. I don't know if she forgot to enforce her rule, but I'm going to assume she was nice enough to leave me with a decent grade.
