N/A,poor,good,poor,4,24074126,0,,poor,1,237,Christina White is the kind of professor to specifically say something won't be on the exam and then make it 25% of the exam. She loves to stand in front of her unreadable mechanisms and get upset when anyone gets something wrong. She does not have office hours and does not make herself available. Belongs in a lab and out of the classroom. ,12/14/2014,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

According to her, if you're taking the class you should already have an introduction to organic chemistry. Her exams are extremely long and convoluted.

N/A,good,average,average,5,22952600,0,,average,5,CHEM237,She is not a nice person but an ok professor. She's a good lecturer but very mean to students and most did not like her. Be prepared for lab exams - they're difficult and she does not curve. She has yelled at us several times and brags about her research. But very possible to get an A with lots of studying,03/26/2014,3,3.0,,1,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people

The class itself can be enjoyable (esp compared to old chem classes), but the only thing that save me were the TAs. Be prepared to study for her lab exams and don't expect a curve.

Biggest complaint is the professor herself. She has no interest in teaching at all which she explicitly stated to me in a research group interview. If you are looking for a real teacher look elsewhere. Avoid her at all costs.",10/28/2013,3,3.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people
