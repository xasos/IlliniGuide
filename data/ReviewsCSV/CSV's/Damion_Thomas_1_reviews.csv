N/A,average,poor,poor,0,11385923,0,,poor,2,KIN249,Dr. Thomas (Don't call him Damion!) seems well educated but don't let the buttoned down white shirt fool you - he makes no sense! All of his material is made up from his own ideas with no backbone. He is very unorganized and has no structure to his material. I would not recommend taking his class!,01/18/2006,1,1.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
