She would often spend 15 minutes on one slide, retelling the same anecdote about one of her family members. In addition, though she tried to give helpful feedback, she came across as overly critical and harsh.",03/30/2016,3,3.0,,2,N/A,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A+,,person,person

I took this class because it's a 100 level sociology course, and it sounded interesting, so I thought ""how hard could it be""? Her expectations are not clearly stated, she rambles in lectures, and she grades students' papers like they are submitting their dissertation.

She has pretty high expectations for an undergrad level course in my opinion but it is doable. She just makes you do a lot of little assignments that pointless. Tests are hard and specific. i really liked the subject but not her, she was really fake. ",12/15/2014,4,4.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
