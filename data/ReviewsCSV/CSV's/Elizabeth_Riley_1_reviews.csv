It's a lecture with like 200+ students, but she literally screamed at people for whispering. Just study really hard for the tests and you'll do okay. Stats is generally not that hard.

Not Mandatory,average,poor,average,0,22794290,0,,average,3,STAT100,This class is basically easy and she allows you to bring note card without any exception what you want to write on it. Sometimes she came late to the class and even during the final exam although the time to finish the exam was more than enough.,01/26/2014,1,1.0,,2,Low,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She makes you feel stupid when you speak up in class and ask for help. She's very rude and critical, I would not recommend taking her course. Try finding another professor if you have to take STATS 100!",11/14/2013,1,1.0,,2,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She knows the material very well(she co-authored the textbook) and has a natural talent in explaining complex mathematical subjects in a simple way. Her course made me interested in studying statistics more in future.",12/23/2012,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
