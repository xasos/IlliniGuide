N/A,good,good,good,0,14986469,0,,good,4,ENGL104,"While it seemed like every class was a battle to keep his temper intact, Simeone is nonetheless an intellectual, caring, professional, and well-spoken instructor. Sure, he seems constantly angry, but I suppose that's worth it if it means having a teacher who is actually intelligent.
