Mandatory,good,average,good,1,24550384,0,,good,5,CEE330,"One of my favorite professors I've had, just because he is very personable and his lectures are extremely clear. Environmental engineering isn't the most interesting topic, so lectures can be boring at times, but I have no doubt I would not have done as well as I did with a different teacher. Attendance is taken daily and all work is done in groups",04/06/2015,3,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A-,,people,person

Willing to meet all the time, including coming in early and setting up extra study sessions. Constant group work though which can be a pain.",01/12/2015,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

He comes around to help students once he's given the class stuff to work on, so you never feel lost in the crowd. There's a final group project that isn't too hard. I learned a lot and really enjoyed this class overall.",12/30/2014,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person

You'll be working in the same group for weekly homeworks and a final project & presentation, and he has good policies in place to make sure your members pull their weight. Overall very enjoyable class!",12/21/2014,2,2.0,,5,Low,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person
