Surprised she dropped final to give extra time 4 easy group project. You can get honors credit 4 doing just some extra. Serious GPA booster right there. Could be a great class if you can stand the whiners. Too many talkers. Easy A if you do the readings and write well.,06/16/2016,2,2.0,,4,N/A,4,4.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Malaika is a horrible professor and doesn't seem to know how to handle having ""power."" But she does not tell you what information you need to actually retain but she lectures an entire book during lecture.
