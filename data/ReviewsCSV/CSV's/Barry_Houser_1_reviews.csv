The band is becoming more commercialized, as it probably needs to, but the shows performed are not at the same calibre they once were. I hope that as he continues to learn that quality will again be prioritized.",04/25/2013,2,2.0,,4,It's my life,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He wants to make the band more involved and become much better than it currently is.
