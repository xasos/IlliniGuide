Really makes sure students understand the material, and is a very-very fair grader. He's always in a good mood and leaves plenty of time to answer questions. The tests are drawn from the material covered in class. Overall, Dr. Ruan is a great professor :).",12/27/2012,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

What he lacks in English pronunciation, he more than makes up with his clear and nice handwriting. He's well organized and his exams are very fair, his grading  too (he actually cares about careful grading, which is pretty hard for this class) Thumbs up!",01/16/2007,3,3.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
