N/A,average,average,poor,1,24337281,0,,poor,2,CW243,"Often in Thompson-Spires' class, I would ask myself: ""Why does she teach?"" It seems like she really hates teaching; she's very held back and likes to rush through a topic but expects you to write an expert essay the very next day. The mandatory paper conferences are a joke--she won't even read your paper! She gives vague ""help"" and loves busywork.

So its no wonder when you don't get a very good grade on it. She's stoic & unclear on what she wants. I had so many questions about the papers, yet she could never give me clear answers.

Mandatory,average,good,average,0,23740316,0,,poor,2,CW243,Thompson-Spires is ok. She gives TONS of busy work and never really is upfront or clear on anything. It seems like everything she lectures on is more vague and she never gives concrete help. Her mandatory paper conferences are time-wasting because she won't answer your questions and she barely mentions the essay you wrote. She's too vague teaching.,11/04/2014,4,4.0,,2,Low,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
