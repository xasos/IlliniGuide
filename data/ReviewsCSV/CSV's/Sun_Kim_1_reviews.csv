Not Mandatory,good,average,good,2,24782799,0,,good,5,MATH285,"I thought that she was a great teacher, especially compared to others at UIUC math.  She does go fast, but it's all straight from the book.  Tests are not necessarily easy but they are almost exactly like the practice tests, so if you know those forwards and backwards you're fine.  She is a solid second choice for Math 285 if Manfroi is full.",05/09/2015,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

Goes very fast in lectures, and never really pauses to give students time to understand.  Tests aren't too bad because she gives you a practice exam very similar in concepts.  Not great by any means, but not a horrible professor.  ",04/15/2015,3,3.0,,3,Low,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
