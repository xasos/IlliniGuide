N/A,good,average,good,0,10669106,0,,good,5,RHET108,"Kevin is great. The books were great. We even got to watch the movies! The papers arent tooo long. The deadlines are flexible. He allows rewrites for a new grade. Such a cool guy. Heck, Id be friends with him! Hes young and he understands what its like to be a college student. Probably one of the few teachers that will cut you some slack.",10/31/2005,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

He is so understanding and very helpful. He understands the pressure of college life. However, if you don't do your work, you will fail.

He avoids BS High School style discussion and ends class when it should end.  Overall, this class could be a real hassle, but Kevin Matz made it very tollerable.",12/28/2004,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
