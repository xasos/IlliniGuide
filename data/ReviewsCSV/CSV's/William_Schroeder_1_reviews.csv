N/A,good,average,good,0,26181655,0,,good,5,PHIL443,Professor Schroeder did a great job of teaching phenomenology! Lots of reading that you just have to do until you get it. If you go talk with him during office hours you will learn a lot. He really cares whether his students understand the material and will put in time to help! Great class if you want to learn about cool philosophy stuff!,03/24/2016,2,2.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

The terminology used is also very hard to grasp. He can have an arrogant attitude towards students. Avoid this class unless you have a genuine interest in the course and philosophy.",11/10/2011,5,5.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
