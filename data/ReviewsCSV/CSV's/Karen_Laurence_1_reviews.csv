Mandatory,good,average,good,0,24693657,0,,good,5,CLCV232,"Dr. Laurence is an exceptionally engaging professor of Classics. She is thorough and well-spoken on her favorite topic--Ancient Greece. Also, her quirkiness and perspective on the subject is infectious. Close to no homework, but a few take home assignments that are finished quickly if you attended lecture. TAKE HER CLASS!

Mandatory,good,average,good,0,23276306,2,,good,5,CLCV232,"Professor Laurence is a great teacher and I really enjoyed her class. Ignore the syllabus, you don't need to do the readings. The textbook just comes in handy for writing papers. Her one downfall is she is a very unfair grader. She will take points off for things that don't deserve it. But other than that a very fun and enthusiastic professor",05/19/2014,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She goes in depth during the lectures (go to them if you want to get an A) and makes the material interesting and easy to make sense of. If you can take a class with her, do it; you'll be in for a treat. Lots of books for the class, but you really only use one of them.",01/18/2014,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
