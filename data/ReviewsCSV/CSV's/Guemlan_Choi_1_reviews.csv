N/A,average,average,poor,0,21346541,0,,poor,2,MATH228,I was very disappointed. I took Calc 3 and spent hours on MIT's website watching videos of their Calc 3 class. Prof. Choi just taught a procedure and didn't explain any of the concepts or applications of formulas. She usually dismissed class extremely early and was not enthusiastic about math. I would not recommend her for higher level math.,02/16/2013,3,3.0,,1,It's my life,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
