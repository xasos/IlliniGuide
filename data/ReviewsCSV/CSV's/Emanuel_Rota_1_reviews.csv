Mandatory,average,good,poor,0,25425078,0,,poor,2,MDVL240,"I was going into this class expecting it to be great, and it wasn't.  This class honestly just makes no sense it, he is all over the place when he lectures, what he lectures on does not relate to the papers, or the readings. His opinion is the only one that matters, and his demeanor in class makes some situations awkward for students.

You write 3 papers and have a very short and easy final exam. He e-mails you the required readings which are concise and interesting. If you need to knock out a 200-level Humanities, Rota is your guy. He has a habit of wearing LaCoste polos every class.
