Exam questions pretty much follow the notes exactly, so study with the notes and figure out how to do each problem and you should be fine.",11/13/2013,2,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,21901457,1,,good,5,MATH286,"Easy to talk with and class was interesting. Always really excited and quirky which isn't that common in uni instructors; great attitude towards everyone. Go to office hours for written homework if you don't understand something. She does a great job at explaining and 9/10 times you'll have the answer at the end. Attend the ""lecture"" classes.",06/18/2013,2,2.0,,4,Low,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
N/A,average,average,average,1,21682921,0,,average,2,MATH286,She teaches well. But the way she runs the class is not like other math classes here. The logistics of the class were very ambiguous and run in a very non-transparent way. No exam solutions given so you don't know what you did wrong. No past exams to hel p you study. No exam statistics posted... You're basically in the dark all semester.,05/06/2013,3,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person
