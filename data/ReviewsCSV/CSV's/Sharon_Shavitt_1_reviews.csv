When you first meet her you might think she's strict, but she's super nice and easy to talk to. She was always willing to help the students out, and I would highly recommend BADM 323 with her!",05/11/2015,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

They take too much time and effort for her to be vague and then take points off for her own lack of clarity. Shavitt is not at all as interactive and energetic as the class needs (and deserves). Wait to take it with Tiffany White, if possible. I've heard she's MUCH better.",05/09/2012,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,person

She wants everything to be explained to the most minute detail and if not, draft grades will show for it.
