N/A,good,average,good,0,17357142,0,,good,5,ANTH240,no clue what the person before me is talking about but that prof is AWESOME!!! the MCQ can be hard if you don t go to lectures but if you do skimming through the readings will be enough to get you an A. He's REALLY interesting and despite having a bias towards minorities he'll definitely hear you out! you just need to back up your case!

N/A,average,average,average,0,16542293,0,,poor,2,ANTH230,"Yells at students. Intolerant of other opinions (even when he asks for it). Bases his lectures 100% on the readings (no original material from the professor). Spelling errors plague his scattered Powerpoints. Basically, he doesn't know how to teach, doesn't have a hand on the information he's teaching, and thinks he's a genius.",12/13/2009,3,3.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
