He is quite clear and does his best to make the lecture as entertaining as possible.

Mandatory,average,good,average,1,25843306,0,,average,3,PHYS212,"PHYS 212 is quite a step up in difficulty from PHYS 211 (I got a B in this class and a A in 211), so as you can imagine, effective teaching is critical. For the most part, I feel like Seppe Kuehn did a good job teaching-or I should say, applying the concepts from the prelectures. Class is structured similar to PHYS 211, so except lots of homework.",12/29/2015,4,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,people,person
