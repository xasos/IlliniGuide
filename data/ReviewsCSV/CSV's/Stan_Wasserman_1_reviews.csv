This is remarkable, because as a researcher he should know that people DO NOT learn through the memorization of formulas and repeating them later on a test, but rather that learning is constructed over time. Time has passed him by-quit now",04/22/2006,3,3.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,3,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
