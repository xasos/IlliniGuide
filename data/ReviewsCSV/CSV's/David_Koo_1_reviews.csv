Mandatory,good,average,good,1,25640572,5,,good,5,ACCY304,Professor Koo is one of the best professors I have met in the College of Business. He is smart and enthusiastic. The posts up there which stated that he is disrespectful are not true. He is passionate about teaching and helping students. He explains those concepts clearly and gives you timely feedbacks.

He is disresectful to students many times just because he is a teacher and we are students. I hate a prof who is aggresive, condescending, and disrespectful to younger students.

He was unwilling to help during office hours because he was ""here for research, and I was interrupting him."" Not only was he unwilling to help, but he would get angry and unprofessionally aggressive towards students who he felt crossed him.

But Professor Koo wrote the final for his own section so it becomes way more approachable. Just make sure to go through all the PPTs and read through the book and you should do fine.
