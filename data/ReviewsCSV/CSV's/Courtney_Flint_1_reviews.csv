Anyways, the class was fairly easy. Just take notes & go to lecture. Discussions highlighted main points. Essays were easy if you just follow guidelines. Tests are not too difficult if you actually do the readings (questions can be specific).",05/11/2013,2,2.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Also bragged about her money and properties she owns - hated going to class. Exams were very specific so do the readings on time and then reread before exams. 4 papers with 3pg MAX, no minimum.

Her expectations were reasonable-low, she expected you to attend class but the discussion ""quizzes"" were easy and so were the exams.  The three hmwk assignments were reasonable and didn't take long. Take the class!!",10/08/2012,2,2.0,,4,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
