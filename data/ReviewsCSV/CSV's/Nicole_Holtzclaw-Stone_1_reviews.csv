I skimmed the readings and did well on all the assignments. Most interesting part for me was the group project about a community resource, but that's obviously hit or miss depending on your group.",03/15/2016,2,2.0,,2,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

I was surrounded by intelligent people who never got the chance/encouragement to participate.  Her lectures are embarrassingly unsophisticated.  It's a miserably dead class. It takes an immense amount of effort to learn anything, you're taught nothing.",04/07/2014,2,2.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,person

Be aware that the professor will try to screw you over whenever possible. Watch out, she seems nice, but will find some way to ruin your class experience. I don't recommend this class because of this.",01/08/2014,2,2.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

If you are looking to take an interesting course or learn about anything at all, keep looking. Definitely an easy A course, and know that reading ANY of the assigned readings is unnecessary. She reads her notes directly from paper, and can't elaborate on anything.  Ask anyways, it's funny.",12/30/2013,1,1.0,,1,Meh,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people

N/A,poor,average,poor,0,21482665,0,,poor,1,SOC160,Honestly the worst teacher I have ever had. She reads all of her notes off of a piece of paper she typed out and when you ask a question she cannot elaborate because she has no idea what she is talking about. Her prompts for essays are not clear at all! I can honestly say I learned NOTHING in this class.,04/03/2013,2,2.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
