N/A,good,average,good,0,23308966,0,,good,4,ENGL455,Coen brothers film class. He was very enthusiastic about the subject matter and fairly laid back and pleasant in contrast to the other reviews I'm seeing on here. He was more interested in having fruitful discussions than he was in being a punitive instructor or administering pop quizzes and lots of homework/readings.

The prompts for his papers can be really convoluded and he's honestly only looking for a certain thesis an pretty specific supporting arguments. Overall there are multiple crude names that would be perfectly fitting for the dude.,12/17/2013,3,3.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,B-,,people,people

I even started asking questions (of the class) one day because I couldn't stand just sitting there.   The texts were interesting, just not the way he presented them.
