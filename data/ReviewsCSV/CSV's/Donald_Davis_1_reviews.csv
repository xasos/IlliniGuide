He assigns a lot of case studies that take 5+ hours to complete with your group. But in the end he will generously curve the class or just throw you a grade based on how much he likes you.

Notes are through Power Points posted on Compass, but participation points are given through i-clicker questions, so go to class. Tests are open note and largely made up of policy questions.
