N/A,poor,good,poor,0,25174035,0,,poor,1,PSYC494,Worst professor I've ever had to deal with. Refuses to answer emails no matter how urgent or frequent they are. Clearly does not care for her undergraduate students at all. I had to drop my advanced research project because she'd never respond to my multiple emails. Avoid at all costs.

I would never recommend this class and highly recommend you find someone to suffer through with you.

Also- the class is extremely psych heavy, so it is really hard for leadership minor students.",05/06/2014,3,3.0,,3,Low,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,B-,,person,people

Sifts all communication through her TA, who is mostly poorly informed.  Assigns tedious amounts of work on assignments, though there are only 2.  Tests are easy, attendance not required.  Reads slides and drones on about details, not focusing on complex topics. Skip",02/25/2014,3,3.0,,1,Really into it,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
