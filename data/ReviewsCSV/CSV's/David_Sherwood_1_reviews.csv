If you want a challenge and find the material interesting, take this class. If you want an easy Life Science Gen Ed, I'd take something in IB instead.",05/06/2014,5,5.0,,5,Sorta interested,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,B+,,people,people

To do well, you really have to pay attention in class & take notes on the lectures (which he puts online, very helpful!) so attendance is mandatory. The tests are kinda hard but if you study the slides/lectures well, they're not too bad. Don't need the book.",11/15/2011,3,3.0,,3,Low,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
