She gives great constructive criticism and she really takes the time to help you if you need it.",12/16/2010,3,3.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She picks favorites early on & if you're not a favorite then good luck! A lot of the assignments are pointless & busy work, which most other com 102 teachers don't give out. if you get her for any class, SWITCH OUT!",07/15/2009,5,5.0,,2,Meh,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The course material is sort of hard and is quite overwhelming at times, but Osterhout explains things pretty well, and gives you exact outlines of what you have to do and what she expects from an assignment. She is pretty lenient with deadlines and things like that. Lectures aren't too boring, and she gives extra credit.",12/19/2005,3,3.0,,5,Low,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
