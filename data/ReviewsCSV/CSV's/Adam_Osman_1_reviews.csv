N/A,average,average,average,0,26298391,0,,good,2,ECON490,Dr. Osman is an amazing professor. He is very enthusiastic about the material. The low workload makes the class more enjoyable for me because I'm able to focus more on learning rather than the actual grade.

N/A,good,average,good,0,24123748,0,,good,5,ECON490,Dr. Osman is a great professor! It was his first time teaching and you can tell he loves the subject a lot. He's really nice and the workload is light which is refreshing since a lot of other classes just cause stress and you only focus on the grade. Here it was less pressure and I felt like I actually learned useful stuff. ,12/17/2014,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

He is very knowledgeable and willing to help if you ask. Grading was inconsistent.  Was a blow off at first, by the end grading was much harder (Probably due to it being his first semester.) 2 homeworks, 1 presentation, 2 exams: LOW workload!",12/04/2014,3,3.0,,3,It's my life,3,3.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
