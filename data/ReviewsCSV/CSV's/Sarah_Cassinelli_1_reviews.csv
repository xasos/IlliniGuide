N/A,good,average,good,0,24179644,0,,good,4,ENGL109,"S. led a class that was geared toward literature with social issues, however, she skillfully ensured that this was not the sole focus of our discussions and thus it was very interesting. It was the one class of mine I was sure not to miss and even through the 20+ pages I wrote for the class, I loved doing all of it.",12/23/2014,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people

She had 3 5 page papers due through the semester and a 7-10 page research paper, so be prepared to write, but she really is very helpful if you reach out to her.

It is extremely one-sided, little to no group work, instead she lectures the entire class. She is a nice lady, but she fails to realize the entire class is dying when she speaks. She's a fair grader, but the class is death.",03/06/2013,3,3.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
