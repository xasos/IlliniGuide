Lectures are extremely boring unless he decides to turn on the funny. He makes the class extremely easy because all the exam questions come from lecture notes.

I'm furious I didn't.  He is very hard to understand, straight powerpoint lecture, not sociable outside of class, and you have to read 4 novels and one is like the Chinese version of Shakespeare.
