Mandatory,good,average,good,0,26706359,0,,good,5,590IC,"Took this class as a follow-up to his Fall business research course.  Definitely more hands-on, with a real project for a real client so the workload is heavier, but so worth it.  Great experience that can be applied to future work - especially for a class.  Highly recommend both course and instructor.",06/08/2016,2,2.0,,5,N/A,5,5.0,1,No,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

His class was incredibly informative, and easily my favorite so far at GSLIS.  Cannot recommend enough.",12/23/2015,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,1,22719704,0,online,good,5,LIS590ACL,"I think this class (590ACL) was the most practical and useful course during my program.  Professor Song brings a wealth of experience in the field of business research, and he's very sensitive to students' needs and expectations.  His assignments are fun and also very similar to ""real-world"" projects.  I enjoyed his class!",01/08/2014,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,person
