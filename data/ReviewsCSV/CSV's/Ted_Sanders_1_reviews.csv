Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25716507,0,,good,5,CW404,Ted Sanders is probably my favorite CW teachers I've had. He has a great sense of humor and is really great at critiquing work in a critical way because you know he really wants to help you improve your writing. He gives off an amazing atmosphereprobably the best one I've had in a workshop class. I would take another one of his classes again :),12/15/2015,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

He won't tell you what you want to hear, he'll tell you what you need to hear: the truth about your writing. If you want to get better, I recommend him. If you want to go nap in a bed of daisies, take someone else.",05/24/2014,2,2.0,,5,It's my life,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people
Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,22680247,0,,good,5,CW404,"Ted is a rare combination of a brilliant writer and a brilliant teacher. He's brutally honest. He won't tell you what you want to hear and he has made kids cry in workshop. That being said, he's surprisingly approachable and super committed to making sure his students get better. If you are serious about writing, this class is invaluable.",01/01/2014,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,A+,,people,people

He grades tough. If you wanna do well, you have to write the way he wants it to be written. Listen closely in class and you should do okay. Also, he's lax on attendance but skipping alot will hurt ur grade in theend",05/15/2009,3,3.0,,3,Meh,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
