Mandatory,poor,average,poor,4,23046665,0,,poor,1,MUS202,"She never shows up to class on time. Sometimes she doesn't even show up to class at all and has TAs cover on late notice without leaving them a plan. When she does show up she doesn't teach anything. It's pretty clear she has no desire to be teaching. Really shouldn't be a professor here, wastes students time and money.",04/16/2014,2,2.0,,1,Meh,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,poor,average,poor,3,22858039,0,,poor,1,MUS426,"MUS 426- Orchestration. Didn't show up to the first two weeks of class, and doesn't respond to emails. Our first assignment was to read the whole book, and then all she had us do was transcriptions, even after she had shown us the answers (turned into just copying.) Lots of busy work, could have learned the same amount by simply reading the book.",02/21/2014,3,3.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,poor,average,poor,5,22028425,0,,poor,1,MUS202,"Totally unprepared for class. She routinely didnt get started until 10 minutes in to the class. And not once but twice, let her TAs know less than an hour ahead of time that she would be gone and they had to cover the class for her. She seems like a perfectly nice person and is clearly a great composer but Prof. Gee is lacking in instructional skil",08/06/2013,2,2.0,,1,Low,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
