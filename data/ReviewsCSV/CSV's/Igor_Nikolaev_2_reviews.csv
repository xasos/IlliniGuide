His lectures were very helpful understanding the material.  As it is calculus 3, its not easy to get a good grade with out putting in much effort, but definately one of the best professors you can have for math 241.",08/28/2007,2,2.0,,4,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Hard to follow lectures due to complex notation that is not explained.  Friends in Denka's class say she is a better professor.  Avoid Igor in 241 if possible.,12/13/2006,4,4.0,,2,Really into it,2,2.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
