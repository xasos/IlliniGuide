Mandatory,good,good,good,0,24242767,0,,good,5,CHM550,"Dr. Rafferty was a great professor. He really cared to see us do well in his class. He wouldn't hand anything to you, but if you show up to class, listen, ask questions and do what's required, you can expect a good grade. He writes all of his notes with you in class, so he is really easy to follow.
