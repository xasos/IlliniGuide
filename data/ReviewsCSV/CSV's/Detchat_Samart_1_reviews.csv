Not Mandatory,good,good,good,1,26727067,0,,good,4,MATH286,"Admittedly his lectures are a little bit boring. However he explains concepts very clearly and gives enough examples in class. The class (Differential Equation) is a hard one, indeed. But that's not the fault of the instructor.",06/15/2016,4,4.0,,4,N/A,4,4.0,1,Yes,Yes,1112,Yes,,A,,people,person

I failed the first (easiest) midterm trying to understand his lectures and got a B+ on the second after I stopped going to lecture.
