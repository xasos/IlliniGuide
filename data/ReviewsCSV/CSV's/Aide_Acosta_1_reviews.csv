She knows nothing of the subject she teaches and cannot even speak correct English. Very unprofessional, very boring, and extremely irritating.

If you really read the readings and take advantage of the resources Aide provides, an A is easy to get.  The reason a TA walked around shushing people is because it was needed =p Tests are easy (for example, you can argue your case on a T/F question!)",06/03/2011,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

She treated everyone like we were little kids; even employing the TA's to walk around and police us during lecture. I'm certain she knows nothing about her subjects that she teaches.

She only reads passages from the book to teach the class, she actually doesn't know anything. And if you listen carefully every 3 minutes you will hear her say &quot;what else&#63;&quot; Which by the way are the only original words she is can say.

As long as you go to class you will be able to do well on the quizzes. As for the tests, All the questions on the exams where from the quizzes just memorize the quiz questions and you should do well.",12/30/2010,2,2.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,poor,good,0,17680784,0,,good,5,ANTH103,"Needs to have more extra credit. Getting an 85 on one of the midterms pretty much guarantees you won't get an A in class, since the minimum is 94% (and good luck getting 100 on a final or a midterm, since there will always be at least a couple poorly worded ambiguous questions). Other than that, she's a pretty good teacher, definitely not a 1.0!",10/21/2010,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
