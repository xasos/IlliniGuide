N/A,good,average,good,0,25642288,0,,good,5,ADV150,One of my favorite classes. Go to lecture! 80% of the test comes from his lecture examples and definitions. You only have 4 tests (no final) and a project. The tests are very straightforward (he gives very detailed review guides and notes can be found online). He gives a fair amount of extra credit as well. Great class and professor!,12/11/2015,2,2.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
