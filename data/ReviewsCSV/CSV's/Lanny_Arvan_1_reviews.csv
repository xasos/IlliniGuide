When he realized that everyone was doing bad and made the final a joke. I never went, went through the homework, bombed the first two tests, rocked the final and got a B. Not a bad 302 class...",10/12/2011,3,3.0,,3,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Arvan did not teach with a text book, and he spent the entire class lecturing on material not on the test.  It was virtually impossible to learn the material.  If you have another option for Econ 302, go with it.",07/24/2011,4,4.0,,3,Meh,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
