Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,1,24158697,24,,poor,1,ECE205,This class broke my high grade streak. I poured hours into studying.  I also watched an ENTIRE CLASS by MIT on equivalent material.  He teaches you basic circuit analysis. But his exams test on circuit design.  This professor cannot speak English. He writes too small on the chalk board. He makes so many mistakes.
