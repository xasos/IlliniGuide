Using the index, the online learning program that came with the book and certain websites can give you the page numbers to some of the tricky, hidden questions that are on the quizzes and tests. Always check answers!!",12/31/2012,3,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

When I encountered incorrect quiz/test questions, I emailed her with page numbers to support my inquiry and she happily fixed the questions in the question bank.  She was very kind, helpful, and encouraging, and I'd definitely recommend this class.",01/06/2012,1,1.0,,5,It's my life,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,average,good,poor,0,18779879,0,,poor,2,CHLH243,"I didn't like her.  Even when she was shown that test questions were worded incorrectly and that the answer was wrong due to that fact, she insisted on believing she was in the right.  Sorta has a superiority complex even though she's quite green.  Not sure if she really understands the complexities of drug abuse and dependence.
