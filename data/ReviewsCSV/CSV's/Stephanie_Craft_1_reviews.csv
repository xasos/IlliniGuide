Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,24878369,0,,good,4,JOUR205,"Craft was a great professor for JOUR 205. However, there are NOT a lot of opportunities for points. Your grade is ultimately determined by 3 tests (which are only out of about 40 points) and some reading responses if you choose to do those. She was not clear about how important the tests were, so it's easy to not do well in the class.",05/20/2015,5,5.0,,4,Low,4,4.0,1,No,N/A,1112,Yes,,C,,people,people
