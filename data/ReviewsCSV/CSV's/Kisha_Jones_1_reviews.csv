I guess the subject isn't super interesting but the presentation of slides was soporific to say the least. Don't take it if you don't have to.",07/19/2012,3,3.0,,3,Meh,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
N/A,average,average,average,0,19601468,0,,good,3,PSYC245,"Kisha is nice and helpful, but she could teach with a little more enthusiasm.  Class is pretty dry. Most students attended class only for the pop quizzes. The tests are semi-difficult, but she gives out a lot of extra credit! And she grades assignments leniently. So if you actually go to class and semi-pay attention, you should do well.",12/22/2011,3,3.0,,4,Low,3.5,3.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

Not really any homework, but midterm and final account for a lot of your grade. They're not easy. Uninspiring.

The course contains very dry and boring information. Try not to fall asleep or stray away. Professor is semi-helpful if you go to her office hours. Fail one exam, you're screwed. Don't really recommend but if you do, good luck!",11/04/2011,4,4.0,,3,Low,2.5,2.5,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
