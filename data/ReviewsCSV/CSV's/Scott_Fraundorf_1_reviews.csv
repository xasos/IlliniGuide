N/A,good,poor,good,0,17441482,0,,good,5,PSYC100,"Scott was awesome! Totally nice guy that really wants you to succeed in class.  He teaches with powerpoints each day but also tries to mix things up and make things fun with random group games and lots of YouTube videos. I've heard other people in diff. sections of PSYC 100 thought the class was awful, but Scott really prepares you well. great guy!",07/22/2010,1,1.0,,5,Really into it,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

N/A,good,average,good,0,15598485,0,,good,5,PSYCH100,"Scott is an awesome psych professor!  He's young and definitely relates to his students with pop culture references and fun games.  At times he can make the activities and memory tricks a little too far-fetched, but he has a heart of gold and really cares that his students succeed.
