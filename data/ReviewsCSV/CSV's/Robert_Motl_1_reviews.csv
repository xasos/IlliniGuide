N/A,average,good,average,0,21313155,2,,poor,3,KIN446,Dr Motl was mildly entertaining at times but we were demanded to memorize pointless studies verbatim and spit them out on ridiculous essays in detail. I went into that class with a great attitude and very excited about exercise psychology. He likes to belittle people occasionally and calls people out.
