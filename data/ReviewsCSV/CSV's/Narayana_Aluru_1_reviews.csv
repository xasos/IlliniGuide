N/A,good,poor,good,0,15370160,0,,good,5,ME310,He was a very good teacher who is easy to follow as all he does is rewrite his notes on overheads and explains them. You should get an A by just copying his notes as he writes. Some of the problems on one of the tests were unfairly scored and he won't really budge. Tests aren't bad and homework should take you less than 3 hours to complete.,01/14/2009,1,1.0,,3,Really into it,4,4.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

The good teacher would help the student move on. Also, a good teacher would give us test & assignment days.
