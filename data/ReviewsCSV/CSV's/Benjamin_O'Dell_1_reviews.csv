Mandatory,average,good,average,0,23161648,0,,poor,2,ENG210,"Horrible class& its because of the teacher. I had 4 English classes this semester, all 200 level& only one 300 level. The teacher taught this one WAY harder than my 300 level class. I read the texts& still had no idea what he was talking about. No one would answer his questions in class, it was so boring. I will AVOID HIS CLASSES AT ALL COST!",05/04/2014,4,4.0,,2,Sorta interested,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
