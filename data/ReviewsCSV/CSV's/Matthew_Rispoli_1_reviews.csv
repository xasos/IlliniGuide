N/A,good,poor,good,0,20269606,1,,good,5,SHS120,I highly recommend that you take SHS 120 with Rispoli if you want an easy A.  The online quiz questions are taken directly from his powerpoints or the textbook and the exams are open book/open notes.  The only downside is that attendance is mandatory and you meet twice a week for lectures that last 2-2.5 hrs.,05/13/2012,1,1.0,,5,Meh,5,5.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
