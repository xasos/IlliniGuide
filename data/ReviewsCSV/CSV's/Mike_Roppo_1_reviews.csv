Constant errors on examples - which makes taking notes difficult. Test grading: if it didn't line up with his solution, points were taken off, if you had correct but unnecessary information, points were lost. The textbook was not helpful either.",08/22/2013,4,4.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,No,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,person,people
