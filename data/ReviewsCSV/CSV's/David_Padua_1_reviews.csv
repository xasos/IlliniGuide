Mandatory,average,average,average,0,26683615,0,,poor,2,INFO102,"Professor Padua is a nice guy but a frustrating professor. The class was very disorganized, and a clear grading scale was never truly established. The material wasn't too difficult but a lot was covered very quickly so it could quickly become overwhelming. Often grading errors were made.  Knowledge of general computing would be very helpful.",06/02/2016,3,3.0,,2,N/A,2,2.0,1,Yes,No,1112,Yes,,B+,,people,people

This puts him at a disadvantage for teaching CS420 (parallel programming), because he can only explain Fortran 77 and array programming.  The lectures, exams, and machine problems are all completely unrelated.  Avoid this prof if you can!",12/11/2010,3,3.0,,1,Really into it,1,1.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
