N/A,good,average,good,0,25104617,0,,good,4,CEE472,I took Dynamics with Prof. Spencer. He is a good professor but very hard to get a hold of. Lectures are very clear. He uses a digital input instead of writing on the board which comes with its set of pros and cons.  TA was helpful in office hours.,08/08/2015,2,2.0,,5,Low,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people
Mandatory,average,good,poor,0,24441473,0,,poor,2,STATICS,"He is not a good lecturer.  He diverted attention from the main principles of the class by getting us to focus on MATLAB, which was unnecessary for the subject material.    The book he asked us to purchase was terrible. There are books of better quality on the market that he could have recommended.  He showed very little interest in our learning.

He sometimes comes across as mean or crass, but i think in general he is a nice guy. The class is run very well. I didn't do well on some of the tests, but he curved the class substantially.",05/25/2014,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,B,,people,people

Do not go to his office hours, you will be ignored. The class overall is run well. Tests aren't impossible and the homework is from the book and relatively easy, but this class TAKES A LOT OF TIME",03/05/2014,2,2.0,,3,Really into it,3,3.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,A,,people,people
