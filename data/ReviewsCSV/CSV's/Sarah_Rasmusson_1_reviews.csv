N/A,poor,good,poor,0,21314903,0,,poor,1,MACS100,She showed up late every single day.  She collected one of three big assignments. She ranted about past experiences hardly related to the days subject. She gave large sections of assigned reading.  Ridiculous amounts of work with almost no grades back until the end of the semester.  Not a good instructor.
