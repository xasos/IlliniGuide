N/A,poor,good,poor,0,11933707,0,,poor,1,MUS133,This class is probably the worst class that I have taken in college. She is extremely boring and is a horrible lecturer. She is a ditz and her class is not easy. There is no extra credit offered and the TAs are very picky when grading the papers and short answers and essays on the exams. I took this class as a blow-off gen ed and it was not easy.,05/23/2006,5,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1,1.0,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people

All notes are online so there's no reason to go to lecture. It's a super easy class, if you can stay sane through it all. You'll ask yourself &quot;why am I learning this&quot; all the time. Take it with someone else.",05/14/2006,1,1.0,,2,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,N/A,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
