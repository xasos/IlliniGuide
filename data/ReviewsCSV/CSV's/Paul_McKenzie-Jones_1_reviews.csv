If you don't participate in discussion, or go to class, I can't imagine how you'd pass--you get discussion points every day, and wouldn't get vital information about how to complete assignments if you didn't go. You do have to put in work for your grade, but if you do, it should be no problem!",12/17/2014,3,3.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,A,,people,people

DON'T take anything by this prof - his writing requirements mirror some of my 400 level classes, and this is a 100 level class!
