Not Mandatory,poor,good,average,0,26370233,0,,poor,1,MATH410,she is very nice but hard to understand due to accent sometimes. she uses other professor's lecture notes/hw but then creates her own tests which seemed different than what was learned. u need to put in a lot of work on ur own to understand material. answers to class problems not posted until 1-2 weeks later so u must take own notes in class orwait,04/25/2016,4,4.0,,3,N/A,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,B,,people,people
N/A,good,good,good,2,24751060,0,,good,4,MATH409,"A lot of students give Bo a hard time. Her class requires you to focus a lot during lecture. She presents material in a very theoretical framework and assumes that you are following her proofs. She is more than happy to stop and go through things multiple times if need be, you just have to ask. Work hard and you'll do well. Bo is a good professor.",05/06/2015,4,4.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,Yes,,N/A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,22477288,4,,poor,1,MATH409,"Disappointed with the quality. She used the projector:  hard to read and difficulties with operation. Taught in a unclear, confusing manner.  Not enough relevant, helpful examples.  Behind schedule and the class was structured illogically. Exams were heavily weighted toward the harder material. Useless practice exams. But she is nice.",12/09/2013,4,4.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,poor,good,average,0,22477114,3,,poor,1,MATH409,Overall I'm disappointed with the quality. She used the projector: hard to understand and difficulties with operation.  Too much time covering irrelevant material. Her examples were not very helpful. She was behind schedule and the material was illogically spaced. The exams were also more heavily weighted towards the harder material.,12/09/2013,4,4.0,,3,Low,2,2.0,1,Yes,N/A,1112,N/A,,N/A,,people,people
