I would highly recommend switching out of her class if you find yourself in it. The corse seemed fine towards the beginning but went downhill from there.",

Expect vague, confusingly-worded prompts for essays, a syllabus that changes in significant ways weekly, and little concrete help. We never received credit for much of the work we did during the semester- the bulk of your grade is based off of 4 essays.",
