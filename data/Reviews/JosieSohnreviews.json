Our professor for the class was pretty spastic in his teaching style, but she did what she was supposed to do effectively: that is, reenforce the lecture material so we would be prepared for tests.  Her grading style is pretty generous.  She cares about her students, but becomes frustrated and annoyed when students don't cooperate.",
