Don't have to read the book as long as you take notes in class...though his lecture notes are sufficient.  His exams are kind of hard, even if you study a lot...it's all about application.  Great class and prof though.",

I took this during the summer, and the only downside was the class's tendency to run five to fifteen minutes long, due to a lack of bells, but during fall and spring it shouldn't be a problem. As for difficulty, as long as you show up, you'll do fine.",
