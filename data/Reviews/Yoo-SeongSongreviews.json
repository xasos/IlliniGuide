Definitely more hands-on, with a real project for a real client so the workload is heavier, but so worth it.  Great experience that can be applied to future work - especially for a class.  Highly recommend both course and instructor.",

Professor Song brings a wealth of experience in the field of business research, and he's very sensitive to students' needs and expectations.  His assignments are fun and also very similar to \"real-world\" projects.  I enjoyed his class!",
