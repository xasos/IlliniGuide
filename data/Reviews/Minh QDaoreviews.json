He told stories that could not relate to anything, his notes are COMPLETELY unorganized, he rattles off skewerd information from the top of his head, and his TA's were illusions who were the HARSHEST graders EVER.

The whole lecture is him copying the textbook to the board, but you must attend to get HW and quizzes. Will not help even if you ask. Horrible grading procedure. Does not care about students or material. AVOID HIM!",
