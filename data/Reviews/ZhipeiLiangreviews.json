For some students, this works; for others, it doesn't. He's a very energetic teacher that tries to engage the class and, if you need help, he is always willing to assist.",

Without a reliable book to fill in the math parts, this style of teaching left a lot of the students grasping at straws to try to figure out how to solve homework problems. He seemed to get frustrated with students sometimes.",
