Although you do need to put time into the course, it's no easy A, it isn't annoying-it's interesting! I would recommend taking this course. Prof Wong rocks!",

He goes through slides too fast, without explaining what's happening, and we're talking about a 100% mathemathical course here, with lots of matrices and &quot;proofs&quot;.His bad accent doesn't help either. \r The exams were easy and take home, so I studied the whole book myself (which is also very vague).
