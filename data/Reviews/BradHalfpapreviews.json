Tests are very average and he doesn't give much instruction on how to prepare for them. I wouldn't take this unless you have to. You want Will Morong as a TA!!",

(Get points for final exam if u go) Not enough practice except a couple hw problems online, not very good use of the book; don't buy the book unless you're going to use it. Very difficult to understand material if you don't have a good TA. Tons of practice tests online and around 10% curve each exam",
