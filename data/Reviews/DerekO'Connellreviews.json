Philosophy in general is not simple and explaining it seems pretty impossible. I will admit that Derek expects a lot out of his students than we're prepared for considering it's a beginner's class.",

People should avoid complaining about the reading, as he does not demand everyone does %100 of it, let alone understand %100.  For an intro class it is very informative.  I think most people take PHIL classes expecting an easy A, and that is a false assumption.",
