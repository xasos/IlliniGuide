Goes at 300mph (we were a week ahead of the other classes in summer!), doesn't do problems that are too hard for him, but expects us to be able to do them on tests. Screws up examples, quiz questions, and test questions. Didn't curve a test where the average was an F.  I will never take another summer course again thanks to this man.",
