She never seemed to understand what she was talking about, and always acted confused&#63; Was she stoned&#63; I mean seriously, she makes about 10 factual errors per lecture, and if anyone speaks up, she blubbers and sputters and can't clarify because she is perpetually confused. She can't lecture. Easy A though.",
