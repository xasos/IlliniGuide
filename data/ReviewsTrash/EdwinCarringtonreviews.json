The class is pretty easy, the only problem I have with it is how hard he grades the Vlog worksheets that he gives out. The quizzes and the final were easy. Should be a fairly easy A if you are interested in the course material.",

If you do well on these small assignments your grade in the CLASS will be much higher than if you didn't. Quizzes are very easy as well as the exams; just study what he tells you.",
