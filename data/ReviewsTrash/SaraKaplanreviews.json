She's very intelligent, a little bipolar, and kind of rough grader on essays (only 2 though - bad if you bomb one which is easy to do -- have to write what *she* wants). Pop quizzes.  Expects a lot. Speaks in semicolons, which can make her difficult to follow. Probably great for higher level classes, though.",
