Brian is so passionate about his job and is very helpful - he will spend a lot of time and energy to write constructive criticisms on your assignments. He's a personable, intelligent instructor!",

He structures it like a workshop and allows you to get feedback and hear your work critiqued aloud during the class- HW is reading other people's stories, writing paragraph reviews, and three 10-15pg stories. Loved it!",
