He's a big deal in data mining, and he's good at explaining the concepts, although sometimes how he writes his explanations and problems is slightly ambiguous. He's a super nice guy and his enthusiasm for the subject mixed with his accent and demeanor make him kind of charming and unintentionally funny. Would recommend.",
