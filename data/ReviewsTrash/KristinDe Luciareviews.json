The material gets a little dry sometimes, but she does a  good job explaining everything. The tests are based on the power points (posted online). If you go to class, do well on the (open book) reading quizzes, and put in a little effort, you'll get an A. ",

Tests were based on lecture PowerPoints and films.  Easy 10 point weekly online reading quizzes also that can boost your grade.  So overall an easy BUT boring class and not a great professor",
