There were a few times he got lost in proofs (which he does a lot of, but I found most of them helpful) and then he would assign finishing them as homework, but it was pretty tough.  The homework is more difficult than the tests.  I would give him a B+ as a teacher, which is coincidentally what I got in the class.",
