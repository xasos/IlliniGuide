Dave mixes in great activities into his lectures to show leadership concepts and keep the class engaged.  Lecture can be boring at times. This class takes a lot of effort, but it is very practical.",

Some said course was difficult, however, he offered plenty of extra credit - and I noticed the ones who labeled the course difficult were also the students who claimed they didn't study.  Pay attention in lecture, take notes - he's a very fair grader.  Love taking classes with him.",
