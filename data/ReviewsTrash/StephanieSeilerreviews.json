She pretty much relied on her slides to teach the class, but those didn't really help.  attendance was not mandatory, but she did do some checks so you could get 2pts, here and there.  mini-assignments weren't bad, and you only had to do 6/10 or something like that.  easy class to zone out in; pretty much taught myself.  no papers though!",
