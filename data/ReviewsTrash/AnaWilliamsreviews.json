I did not find her accent to be a problem at all. I HIGHLY recommend this class. You do have to be willing to work. Like with anything it takes work to learn, but very enjoyable.",

It's really easy if you know spanish, because alot of the words/grammer is the same.  so you won't have to study much.  plus, Brasilians are hot!",
