We have four blogs to write which took me about 20 minutes each....we meet via Elluminate once a week and have weekly one page summaries that we do in groups and one project as the final.",

We have weekly assignments that are very easy, and each week you'll get faster at the assignments. She's a very easy grader and there are no quizzes or tests! Just a final project that is broken up into 4 steps which makes it easy. Children in Nature is an awesome class!!",
